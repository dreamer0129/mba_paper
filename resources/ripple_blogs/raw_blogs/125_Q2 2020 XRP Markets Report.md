Ripple publishes the quarterly XRP Markets Report to voluntarily provide transparency and regular updates on the company’s views on the state of the XRP market, including quarterly programmatic and institutional sales updates, relevant XRP-related announcements, such as Xpring and RippleNet partnerships, and commentary on previous quarter market developments.

As an XRP holder, Ripple believes proactive communication and transparency are part of being a responsible stakeholder. Moreover, Ripple urges others in the industry to follow its lead to build trust, foster open communication and raise the bar, industry-wide.

Disciplined, Responsible Stakeholders: Continued Pause in XRP Programmatic Sales

In Q2 2020, total XRP sales were $32.55 million (USD) vs. $1.75 million the previous quarter. Ripple continued the pause of programmatic sales, focusing solely on its over-the-counter (OTC) sales as part of providing increased XRP liquidity to RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) customers. This added liquidity is vital as ODL continues to evolve and expand into new corridors.

A healthy, orderly XRP market is required to minimize cost and risk for customers, and Ripple plays a responsible role in the liquidity process. As more financial institutions leverage RippleNet’s ODL service, more liquidity is added into the XRP market. That said, Ripple has been a buyer in the secondary market and may continue to undertake purchases in the future at market prices.

Total sales (OTC-only, given programmatic pause) ended the quarter at 18 bps of CryptoCompare TopTier volumes. This is compared to total sales in the previous quarter (OTC-only, given programmatic pause) of 0.60 bps of CryptoCompare TopTier.

* Percentage is calculated by dividing actual Ripple dollar proceeds by total reported XRP volume in dollars.

**Note: Figures were compiled using the CryptoCompare API for daily TopTier aggregate volumes which reflects total XRP volume in dollars by exchanges that CryptoCompare lists in the TopTier as of the end of Q2. Ripple continues to evaluate its benchmarks given challenges, such as fake volume, that continue to persist in the industry.

CCTT’s reported daily volume for XRP decreased in Q2 2020 from Q1 2020. The average daily volume reported at $196.28 million in Q2 versus $322.66 million in Q1.

VolatilityXRP’s standard deviation of daily returns over Q2 was 3.0%, representing a decrease in volatility from Q1’s 6.2%. XRP’s volatility over the quarter was lower than that of bitcoin (3.4%), and lower than that of Ethereum (4.2%).

Escrow

In Q2 2020, three billion XRP were released out of escrow (one billion each month). In total across the quarter, 2.6 billion XRP were returned and subsequently put into new escrow contracts. For more information on the escrow process, see here. Note: All figures are reported based on transactions executed during the quarter.

On-Demand Liquidity (ODL)

More than ever, financial institutions are seeing the value of RippleNet’s ODL service to provide instant, global payments and meet market demand, especially during times of crisis due to the exposed risk and increased volatility. In Q2 2020, ODL accounted for nearly 20% of RippleNet volume. Comparing just H1 2019 with H1 2020, RippleNet experienced 11x year-over-year growth in ODL transaction volume.

Early on, Ripple identified remittances as its primary use case, and will continue to focus on supporting low-value, high-frequency payments with ODL. Ripple isreducing its emphasis on large treasury payments—which are traditionally used to fund businesses and services in the absence of real-time transfers—to support individual, low-value transactions, addressing the growing need in remittances and small- and medium-sized enterprise payments.

XRP Integrations and Liquidity Update

XRP Integrations

The development of liquid and robust markets is key to the success of ODL. The second quarter of 2020 saw numerous integrations that helped contribute to the health of XRP markets. Of note, Binance launched XRP exchange-traded options contracts. In the derivatives space, XRP perpetuals are now found on all of the top five derivative venues after Huobi DM’s launch of XRP perpetuals in April 2020.

Additional notable integrations from Q2 2020 include:

Ripple hopes to see a continued evolution of XRP infrastructure over the coming months, particularly in the derivatives space, that will further solidify XRP as a top three digital asset, adding to its robustness and liquidity.

Liquidity and Volume

As for overall liquidity and volume, XRP ended the quarter as the fifth most traded digital asset as measured by rolling 30D volume. XRP volume remained relatively strong as overall digital asset volume saw a dip in the second quarter of 2020. The XRP Ledger saw over 85 million in total transactions and XRP’s adjusted transfer value (NVT) ratio was 200.512—the highest among all digital assets in Q2. The NVT ratio compares market cap to on-chain transactional usage, making it a good determination of an asset’s utility. XRPL also saw $20,138 in total transaction fees over the ledger—the lowest among all digital assets in Q2.

XRP is useful for the movement of trading collateral across venues amid an increasingly fragmented crypto infrastructure. As highlighted in the last report, and separately in this blog post, XRP is less costly, more reliable and faster than other assets. There is evidence of an increase in cross-exchange transfers using XRP over peer coins during the market stress caused by COVID-19 in early March 2020. Ripple firmly believes in XRP’s capacity to help bring efficiency into the digital assets markets similar to how it brings efficiency to a fragmented global payments market.

Xpring

In June, RippleX, Ripple’s open developer platform for money, joined over 46+ companies including Blockchain.com, BitPay, Brave, Flutterwave, BitGo, GoPay, Care and Mercy Corps to unveil PayString—a universal payment ID to simplify the process of sending and receiving money globally, across any payment network and currency, including XRP. The companies collaborated on the development of the open-source solution through the Open Payments Coalition, which jointly reaches over 100 million consumers.
