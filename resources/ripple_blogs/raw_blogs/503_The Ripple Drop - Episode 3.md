Team Ripple

Welcome back for episode three of The Ripple Drop, a video series covering the latest news about our customers, technology, products and company culture.

Our first segment offers a deeper look at the Swell 2018 program, our invite-only customer conference connecting the world’s leading experts on policy, payments and technology. We talk to Austin Cowden, Manager of Global Events, to learn more about President Bill Clinton’s keynote and the dynamic line-up of speakers and panelists to follow.

The second segment provides a sneak peek into our recently opened New York City office. We sit down with Hana Kelley, Visual Design Lead, to understand how the Ripple brand is translated throughout this beautiful physical space.

Our final segment features Ripple’s summer 2018 intern class. We’ve had a talented group of students from across the country join every department in the company — from marketing to business development to engineering. They share experiences and highlights working alongside our team in the San Francisco office.

We hope you enjoy this episode, and as always, share via comments on Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook with input for future episodes. An extended cut of this episode will also be available on Youtube. And, if you haven’t yet, make sure to catch up on episode one and episode two!
