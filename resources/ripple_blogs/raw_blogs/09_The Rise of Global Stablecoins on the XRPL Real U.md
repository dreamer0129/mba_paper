A wave of new fiat-backed stablecoins are now live on the XRP Ledger including USDC, XSGD, EURØP, RLUSD, and USDB, accelerating institutional adoption and expanding the utility of XRP, which continues to serve as the native asset for liquidity and transaction fees across the XRPL.

Stablecoins are more than a crypto convenience—they represent essential infrastructure for the digital economy. And nowhere is this more evident than on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), where newly launched stablecoins are making it easier than ever for users and institutions to transact across borders and currencies.

From Singapore to countries in Europe to the United States, stablecoins denominated in three leading currencies—USDC, XSGD, and EURØP—are now live on the XRPL. Together, they reflect growing confidence in XRPL’s regulatory-first design, deep liquidity, and its role as a global blockchain built for real-world finance.

These stablecoins will provide users of the XRPL across Asia, Europe, North America, and Latin America with greater utility and liquidity, as well as more seamless on and off-ramping opportunities. Each stablecoin adds unique value for a specific region and user base, while collectively offering developers and institutions a diverse toolkit for building global applications.

RLUSD, Ripple’s enterprise-grade stablecoin, is already live on the XRPL and backed 1:1 by USD deposits and other cash equivalents. Designed to meet the demands of institutions, RLUSD enables fast, low-cost, and fully compliant cross-border payments and trading on XRPL. With RLUSD volume reaching $500 million in Q2 of this year, we look forward to many exciting milestones ahead.

USDC, the world’s largest regulated stablecoin issued by Circle, went live on the XRPL today. As a fully reserved, dollar-backed stablecoin, USDC will unlock new corridors for remittances, decentralized finance (DeFi), and enterprise-grade payments for millions of users and thousands of developers already active on the XRPL.

XSGD, launched by StraitsX, is one of the most regulated and widely used stablecoins in Asia. Backed 1:1 by the Singapore dollar and issued by a licensed Major Payment Institution regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, XSGD is already live on multiple chains. Its launch on XRPL makes it easier to integrate fast, low-cost payments within a region known for its digital innovation and cross-border trade.

EURØP, from Schuman Financial, brings euro-backed stability to the XRPL for users and businesses across Europe and beyond. Designed to remove the USD dependency often seen in stablecoin markets, EURØP provides users with a simple, compliant way to transact in euros on-chain—whether for remittances, FX settlement, or everyday payments.

USDB, recently launched by Braza Group, is another U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin issued on the XRPL. Backed by a mix of U.S. and Brazilian government bonds and regularly audited, USDB is designed to bring high-performance FX and remittance use cases to Brazil and beyond. It complements Braza’s earlier BBRL stablecoin and is accessible to both institutional and retail users through the Braza On app.

The arrival of these high quality stablecoins represents more than just five new assets—it signals a broader phase of global institutional adoption for XRPL. These are stablecoins built for institutions, issued with transparency, backed by fiat reserves, and anchored in regions with strong regulatory frameworks.

The XRPL’s native digital asset XRP retains a pivotal role, supporting stablecoin use cases by enabling efficient liquidity between assets, powering fast settlement, and serving as a bridge in cross-currency transactions—particularly across the XRPL’s built-in DEX. A user holding USD-backed tokens can directly trade them for EUR-backed tokens on the XRPL DEX, with orders executed within seconds without any centralized intermediary. With payments on the DEX coming soon, it’s an especially exciting time for the XRPL.

This momentum is especially timely as XRPL continues to expand its compliance-first features like Permissioned Domains, Credentials, and Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs). These innovations are designed to support tokenized real-world assets and regulated financial activity—exactly the kind of infrastructure needed for enterprise-grade stablecoin usage.

With built-in tools for token issuance, native support for cross-currency payments, and a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows seamless trading between assets, XRPL offers one of the most stable, performant, and liquid environments for stablecoins globally.

As these stablecoins go live, expect new financial use cases to flourish—from DeFi lending markets and yield-bearing savings products to FX trading, payroll, and cross-border treasury flows.

Developers will be able to build multi-currency payment rails using stablecoins natively supported on XRPL. Financial institutions can tap into these assets for compliant settlement, collateral, and tokenization strategies. And users everywhere will gain access to a truly global set of digital currencies that reflect their local economies—whether they’re transacting in USD, EUR or SGD.

The rise of stablecoins on XRPL is just the beginning. With continued support from trusted issuers globally, XRPL is quickly becoming a go-to platform for stablecoins denominated in the world’s leading currencies with real utility—powering the next wave of blockchain-based finance.
