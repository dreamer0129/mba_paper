XRP COMMENTARY

Volatility, Volume and CorrelationXRP’s volatility of daily returns over the quarter was 2.90 percent, marking Q1 the second lowest volatility quarter since Q4 2013. Rolling volatility of 30-day returns steadily declined throughout the quarter such that XRP volatility of 30-day returns fell to its lowest levels since Q3 2016.

While the price of XRP decreased, the average XRP daily volume was $595.28 million which is on par with XRP daily volume from Q4 2018. In addition, XRP’s correlation with other top digital assets remained consistently high throughout the quarter.

New ExchangesThis quarter, 19 new exchanges listed XRP bringing the total number to approximately 120 exchanges worldwide.

RippleNetAt the start of the quarter, Ripple announced RippleNet surpassed more than 200 customers worldwide, with the addition of 13 new financial institutions that signed up for the company’s payment network. These companies include Euro Exim Bank, SendFriend, JNFX, FTCS, Ahli Bank of Kuwait, Transpaygo, BFC Bahrain, ConnectPay, GMT, WorldCom Finance, Olympia Trust Company, Pontual/USEND and Rendimento.

Of those customers, JNFX, SendFriend, Transpaygo, FTCS and Euro Exim Bank announced that they will leverage XRP to source liquidity on-demand.

MARKET COMMENTARY

Reset during Crypto WinterThe industry has referred to the past several months as the “crypto winter” after a year-long bear market. During this time, blockchain and crypto companies, especially those without a clear use case or utility, were forced to shift business and product goals and/or abandon their projects.

Overall, this is positive for the industry as legitimate businesses gain traction and scams and non-businesses fall by the wayside.

Market Validation from Legacy PlayersSeveral legacy players and technology companies announced new products and blockchain solutions to fix payments, which is a strong validation for the market. Companies are planning to use decentralized blockchain technology and stablecoins to improve payments, while others released new features to fix existing infrastructure and address customer pain points.

In addition, various payment providers are trying to build workarounds to legacy infrastructure to deliver faster, lower cost, more reliable cross-border payments.

The Rise of Digital Banks and Mobile WalletsDigital banks continue to gain traction and are going after traditional banks’ market share. Predominantly in the UK, these contender banks are looking to expand to new geographies and services, including cross-border payments.

Also, there is a growing trend of mobile wallets acquiring cryptocurrency, which increases accessibility to a broader audience. This will likely help drive digital asset adoption, volume, liquidity and credibility.

Here are a few highlights:
