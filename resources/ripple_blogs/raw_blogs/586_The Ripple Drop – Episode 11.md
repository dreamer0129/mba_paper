Welcome to Episode 11 of The Ripple Drop, a web video series covering the latest news about the company’s customers, technology, products and culture.

This month we’re focusing on Ripple strategy around the globe, including our company’s expansion, social impact and the latest event in Southeast Asia.

First, we chat with Director of Business Operations Jinal Surti about what Ripple is doing to expand its presence locally in critical regions where our customers work.

Next, our Head of Social Impact Ken Weber discusses Ripple’s recent partnership with Bay Area non-profit Tipping Point as well as Ripple for Good’s long term giving strategy.

Finally, we hit the ground at Ripple Regionals: Asia Pacific with our events team. Senior Associate Amy Hirth gives us a behind the scenes look at action on stage and the activities on the conference floor.

We hope you enjoy this episode! Feel free to let us know if there are any topics you’d like us to cover in the future.
