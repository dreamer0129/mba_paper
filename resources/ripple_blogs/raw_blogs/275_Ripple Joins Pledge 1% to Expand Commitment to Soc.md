Ripple is deepening its commitment to giving back by joining Pledge 1%, a global movement of companies making positive social impact through their business. Through its Ripple Impact initiative, Ripple is pledging 1% of profits to advancing blockchain innovation, improving access to financial services, scaling carbon markets, and employee-driven local impact.

Since launching Ripple Impact in 2018, Ripple has donated more than $180 million globally to support partners and initiatives that address critical challenges like building financial resilience  in emerging markets, delivering humanitarian aid, and championing blockchain research and development in academia.

“Ripple has long demonstrated leadership in leveraging blockchain technology for social good and philanthropy,” said Jan D'Alessandro, Chief Legal & Philanthropy Officer at Pledge 1%. “With a proven track record of advancing financial inclusion, supporting humanitarian aid, and driving innovation through impactful programs like UBRI, we are thrilled to welcome Ripple to the Pledge 1% global movement and look forward to the impact they will continue to make.”

“Joining Pledge 1% reflects Ripple’s commitment to creating meaningful change through partnership and collaboration with mission driven organizations,” said Ken Weber, Vice President of Social Impact & Sustainability at Ripple. “Our goal is to build a more inclusive and sustainable financial system by leveraging Ripple’s resources, technology and talent. We are proud to stand alongside a growing global community of companies dedicated to creating lasting impact.”

At the foundation of Ripple Impact’s mission is building financial resilience and blockchain innovation. With $80 million committed to the University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), Ripple has partnered with more than 50 leading academic institutions across 26 countries including the University of California Berkeley and University College London. UBRI has supported more than 1,500 blockchain research projects and 600 new or expanded fintech courses.

In emerging markets, Ripple’s long-term partnership with Mercy Corps Ventures has provided investments into 50+ fintech startups, and helped secure $500m in follow-on funding. The recently announced Unlocking Opportunity collaboration will continue to help close the funding gaps for entrepreneurs in Africa, Latin America, and Asia and pilot scalable services built on XRPL for unbanked and underbanked communities.

Ripple has historically partnered with leading humanitarian aid organizations and provided rapid-response funding to organizations such as UNHCR and World Central Kitchen in moments of crisis. Through a new collaboration with the International Rescue Committee, Ripple plans to pilot the use of its blockchain payments products, including soon-to-be-launched RLUSD stablecoin, to enhance the speed and traceability of humanitarian aid delivery.

Ripple has remained ambitious in its commitments to sustainability. The company has pledged $100 million to scaling voluntary carbon markets and funding new solutions that enhance transparency and efficiency in carbon credit trading.

In its journey to net-zero carbon by 2030, Ripple recently joined Block, Samsara, and BlackRock in the strategic purchase of Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificates (SAFc), an effort that will directly add sustainable aviation fuel to Alaska Airlines flights, achieving an estimated 75% reduction in carbon intensity compared to traditional jet fuel.

Ripple fosters a culture of giving by empowering employees to make a difference year-round with its donation-matching program and active local engagement. Ripple employees collectively volunteer thousands of hours annually with nonprofits including Stephen and Ayesha Curry’s Eat. Learn. Play. Foundation in the San Francisco Bay Area, which focuses on promoting children's health, education, and access to nutritious food. In London, Ripple’s partnership with Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity is raising funds for a groundbreaking new children’s cancer center.

These initiatives reflect Ripple's dedication to driving meaningful change both globally and locally.
