As the digital economy matures, stablecoins have emerged as one of the most promising forms of digital currency. Designed to maintain a stable value by pegging to fiat currencies or reserve assets, stablecoins offer a bridge between traditional financial systems and blockchain technology.

Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road—a leading prime broker clearing over $3 trillion annually—has taken this promise one step further. With Ripple USD (RLUSD), we’re now witnessing the first stablecoin to enable efficient cross-margining between digital assets and traditional markets. This move opens the door to new, real-world stablecoin use cases that span institutional finance, payments, tokenized assets, and beyond.

Below, we explore the top use cases for stablecoins like RLUSD and how they’re transforming the financial services landscape.

For banks, asset managers, and hedge funds, stablecoins offer an efficient onramp to decentralized finance (DeFi) without compromising on compliance or performance. RLUSD—built on the XRP Ledger—acts as a trusted, regulated stablecoin that institutions can use to post collateral, settle trades, and unlock liquidity across blockchain-based platforms.

Hidden Road will leverage RLUSD as collateral across its global prime brokerage platform, demonstrating the first real-world application of cross-margining stablecoins in institutional workflows. This allows firms to seamlessly bridge trading activity between FX, derivatives, and digital assets—improving capital efficiency and reducing operational friction.

Stablecoins issued on high-performance blockchains like XRPL allow financial providers to meet growing demand for tokenized fiat currencies. The infrastructure behind RLUSD prioritizes compliance, speed, and settlement finality—key requirements for regulated stablecoin issuers.

Ripple’s long-standing commitment to transparency and working with regulators ensures RLUSD is built on strong foundations and can serve as a model for how stablecoins can be issued and maintained with reliability, and global utility in mind.

One of the most widely adopted use cases for stablecoins is cross-border payments. By bypassing legacy rails, stablecoins significantly reduce remittance fees and enable near-instant settlement.

With RLUSD integrated into Ripple Payments, users and enterprises alike will soon be able to benefit from a stable, fiat-backed digital currency that reduces volatility, improves payment speed, and unlocks access to new corridors—especially in markets with underbanked populations or volatile local currencies.

Stablecoins like RLUSD are becoming foundational to the tokenization of real-world financial instruments. Whether facilitating fractional ownership in tokenized treasury bonds or acting as a settlement asset for decentralized exchanges, they provide stability, liquidity, and trust.

On the XRP Ledger, RLUSD integrates seamlessly with native features such as auto-bridging and the built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), enabling efficient trading and on-chain settlement without the need for complex smart contracts. This makes it an ideal fit for institutional DeFi use cases like lending, cross-border transactions, and tokenized RWAs—especially as new features like Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPT) and compliance-first amendments continue to roll out.

For everyday users, stablecoins function as a more agile and global alternative to a bank account. Whether holding funds in a crypto wallet or transacting peer-to-peer via decentralized apps, RLUSD offers a secure, non-volatile store of value backed by a known issuer with regulatory oversight.

As stablecoin usability expands, crypto users will be able to spend, save, and transfer RLUSD as easily as using traditional banking apps—but with fewer intermediaries and more financial autonomy.

As the crypto market becomes more interconnected with traditional finance, stablecoins are poised to act as reserve assets and universal liquidity layers for the broader Web3 ecosystem. RLUSD’s design allows it to serve as a reliable settlement asset for everything from decentralized lending protocols to NFT marketplaces and real-time micropayments.

Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, which rely on automated monetary policies and can be prone to collapse, RLUSD is a fully USD-backed stablecoin issued by Ripple on the XRP Ledger. It combines the transparency and programmability of blockchain with the trust, licensing, and reliability that institutions demand.

By becoming the first stablecoin to enable cross-margining between traditional and digital markets, RLUSD isn’t just keeping pace—it’s setting the standard for what enterprise-grade digital assets should look like.

From financial institutions and stablecoin issuers to individual users and developers, the use cases for stablecoins are more diverse and impactful than ever. RLUSD stands at the center of this evolution—supporting compliance, efficiency, and growth across the entire financial value chain.

As stablecoins become essential infrastructure for the global economy, RLUSD is proving that utility, trust, and innovation can coexist in a single asset.
