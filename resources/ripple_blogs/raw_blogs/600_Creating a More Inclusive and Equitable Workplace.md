Team Ripple

Creating meaningful change starts within our own company. That’s why we are evaluating and improving the ways we attract, hire, retain and create equity for our employees with diverse backgrounds and lived experiences.

First, we are focused more intentionally on creating a culture of inclusion and belonging for everyone:

Second, we are committed to increasing diverse representation within our leadership roles across all functions and regions.

Third, we are committed to diverse candidate pools and shortlists, and are taking action to ensure this is the norm, not the exception:

Building a more inclusive and equitable workplace is a collective process, and we want to thank the many Ripple employees who have come forward to share their perspective, lived experiences and ideas as a way of enriching and helping to guide our efforts. We are committed to continue to listen to, support and create change with you.
