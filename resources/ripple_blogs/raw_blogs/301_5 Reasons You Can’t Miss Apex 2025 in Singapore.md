Apex 2025 is more than a conference—it’s the annual heartbeat of the XRP Ledger community. This year, it lands in Singapore for the very first time, at the Raffles City Convention Centre, bringing the global XRPL ecosystem to one of the most exciting innovation hubs in the world. From June 10–12, developers, founders, institutions, and Web3 pioneers will gather to explore what’s next for decentralized finance, the growth of institutional activity, tokenization, stablecoins, and much much more!

If you’re part of the XRP Ledger community—or just getting started—here’s why you won’t want to miss this year’s summit.

Asia Pacific is at the forefront of web3, and Apex 2025 is your front-row seat to that evolution. As regulators, fintech leaders, and developers across the region take bold steps toward institutional adoption of crypto, Apex offers a rare opportunity to meet the teams driving real-world use cases—from stablecoin frameworks in Japan to tokenized treasuries in Singapore.

Singapore, a global capital for finance and innovation, is the ideal host. The city’s dynamic mix of enterprise and crypto-native culture mirrors what XRPL stands for: open innovation, trusted infrastructure, and cross-border collaboration. This year, Apex is not just coming to Asia—it’s celebrating the region’s leadership on the world stage.

XRPL is evolving fast—Apex is where you get to see what’s coming before it hits the chain. Whether it’s the rollout of the Institutional DeFi roadmap, native programmability, or new standards for compliance-ready DeFi, Apex is the ultimate venue for early insights and technical deep dives.

Expect demos, ecosystem showcases, and roadmap updates from RippleX and core contributors, plus firsthand looks at tools and protocols pushing XRPL forward. With growing support for stablecoins, real-world assets (RWAs), DID-based identity, and EVM compatibility, XRPL is becoming one of the most flexible public blockchains for financial use cases. At Apex, you’ll see the next layer of that transformation take shape.

In 2024, Apex featured 88 speakers and 60 sessions, offering a packed agenda of thought leadership, education, and technical knowledge-sharing. This year, expect even more as leaders across DeFi, TradFi, public policy, and Web3 converge to discuss where the industry is headed.

From onchain compliance and tokenized capital markets to cross-chain liquidity and blockchain-AI convergence, you’ll hear from the people building and shaping the future of finance. Whether you’re a developer looking for best practices or an enterprise leader seeking real-world success stories, Apex delivers the insights and access that matter.

Apex 2025 is where virtual connections become real. It’s where developers meet collaborators, founders meet investors, and builders become part of something bigger. With hundreds of attendees from every corner of the XRPL ecosystem, the connections made at Apex are one of the event’s biggest returns.

Expect community-led sessions, breakout discussions, and live feedback from the people shaping XRPL today. Whether you’re exploring a new use case or scaling a protocol, there’s no better place to find alignment, share ideas, and get inspired.

Let’s face it—Apex is also a lot of fun. From the energy of the main stage to the casual chats over coffee (or cocktails), the experience is curated to fuel creativity, spark connections, and celebrate progress. Dive into hands-on workshops, try new dApps and tools, and close out your day at Apex After Hours, our official community party.

This is where Web3 meets real life—and where the ideas discussed on stage turn into the partnerships and products of tomorrow. Bonus: you’ll go home with exclusive Apex 2025 swag, unforgettable memories, and a renewed sense of purpose in the ecosystem.

Apex 2025 is more than just the community’s biggest event of the year—it’s where the future of blockchain finance comes into focus. Join us in Singapore and be part of the movement that’s shaping open, inclusive, and institutionally-ready infrastructure on XRPL.

Register now and secure your place at the global summit for builders and believers in the XRP Ledger.
