Team Ripple

Every Rippler, from the executive team to our newest hires, started their careers in one place — the classroom. It’s in this pivotal setting that children’s dreams are forged and legacies begin.

Take, for example, Ripple’s mission to establish an Internet of Value: a world where money can move like information. In part, it’s the teachers we encounter in our formative years that enable us to pursue ambitious goals like this.

We’re thrilled to announce that Ripple and its executive team are giving back to America’s teachers with a $29 million dollar donation in XRP to DonorsChoose.org.Through DonorsChoose.org, teachers can easily create classroom project requests that support their students’ needs, and donors are able to give to the projects that inspire them.

Our donation fulfilled every request listed on the nonprofit’s website yesterday. Today, nearly 30,000 public school teachers in every state and approximately one million students are receiving books, school supplies, technology, field trips, and other resources vital for learning through DonorsChoose.org.

You can join us by contributing to the new projects that teachers are already creating on DonorsChoose.org. As part of the #BestSchoolDay campaign, you can give to teachers and students within your community, where you grew up or just because they inspire you.

As a company, we’re focused on removing the friction from cross-border payments to promote more inclusion and accessibility within the global economy. DonorsChoose.org applies the same principles of inclusion and accessibility to education.

We’re proud to be working with DonorsChoose.org to nurture the next generation of leaders at public schools across America.
