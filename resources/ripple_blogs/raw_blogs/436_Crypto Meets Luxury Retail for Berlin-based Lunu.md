Luxury retail shoppers will soon be able to make in-store and online purchases with crypto thanks to Lunu’s newest partnership with Ripple. Lunu’s point of sale (POS) terminal and online widget enable luxury retailers in the UK and Europe to accept crypto as a payment method. And as the leader in crypto solutions for business with more than ten years of experience working with financial institutions, Ripple is well equipped to bring crypto solutions to this high-end retail sector through Liquidity Hub.

Ripple’s Liquidity Hub will allow enterprises to source digital assets at the best prices across multiple venues using a single, streamlined API. With more than a decade of information gathered working at the intersection of the finance and tech industries, Ripple deeply understands the value that crypto can offer enterprises and their end users.

By providing a simple, efficient experience to onboard crypto solutions into product offerings, enterprises big and small will have the opportunity to source and leverage crypto for their business.

Ripple’s New Value report, which was published in February of this year, found that 56% of individuals surveyed globally are more likely to purchase from a retailer that offers payment with crypto. Giving customers this added option opens the door to new demographics and positions brands as technologically progressive and responsive to the interests of consumers.

“For luxury retailers, it is vital to stay on top of the latest trends, and when it comes to payments the greatest innovation is coming from the evolving crypto scene. Thanks to Lunu these retailers get access to new, younger, more affluent audiences that are constantly growing in numbers. Our partnership with Ripple has the potential to greatly impact retailers’ customer service offerings by expanding the variety of payment methods and by portraying retailers’ brands as more innovative and progressive,” explains Rajesh Madhaiyan, Director of Product at Lunu.

Some high-profile retailers are leaning even further into blockchain technology—through exclusive NFT drops and digital real estate—to enhance their image as a contemporary brand and engage new customers alongside the crypto industry at the dawn of web3.

“Crypto liquidity is the common thread that underpins all of Ripple products. Our ambition is to build a suite of enterprise-oriented crypto products for the benefit of our clients and their customers. This is why we are so excited by this fantastic new use case for Liquidity Hub which will enable Lunu’s luxury retail clients to accept crypto payments at the point of sale,” says Sendi Young, Managing Director, Europe, Ripple.
