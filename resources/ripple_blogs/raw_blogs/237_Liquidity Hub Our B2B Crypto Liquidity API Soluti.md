Explore how Liquidity Hub can help businesses manage their crypto liquidity needs in a multi-asset future.

## 核心内容

Team Ripple

We are excited to announce that Ripple Liquidity Hub is officially open for business. Last year we launched a successful pilot, and now Liquidity Hub is publicly available to provide businesses with a simple, seamless way to manage their modern crypto liquidity needs. Designed for usability and interoperability, it gives enterprise customers a competitive advantage in a multi-asset future.

A Future Defined by Liquidity

We are rapidly moving towards a multi-asset reality wherein consumers and businesses will have to manage a broad portfolio of assets across fiat, cryptocurrencies, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and more.

Businesses must be able to move into and out of these distinct assets quickly and easily regardless of the number of users on the platform, trading volume, and market efficiency—all aspects which may impact liquidity. A key component to this is ensuring businesses do not have to sacrifice value in order to execute transactions like affordable, real-time cross-border payments. Crypto and digital assets can also enhance transparency and facilitate treasury functions.

These use cases all hinge on interoperability, requiring strong on- and off-ramps between crypto and fiat and deep pools of liquidity between asset pairs—or a crypto asset to bridge lesser pools.

Maximize Crypto Liquidity

Liquidity Hub was created in response to the gap and inefficiencies associated with bridging the world of crypto and fiat. It functions as a standalone solution or an extension of our cross-border payments solution which leverages our global network to provide partners access to payout rails worldwide.

As a turnkey solution for enterprises, Liquidity Hub was designed to source digital assets from the broader crypto market more easily and efficiently. We wanted to make it as frictionless as possible for businesses looking to supercharge liquidity, power crypto payments and operations, or support end-customers interested in buying, selling or holding crypto.

“Liquidity Hub benefits from all the hard-won lessons Ripple gained sourcing liquidity from other providers and across multiple venues for ODL. It combines ease of use, powerful payment integrations, cost savings and more into a single, scalable enterprise-grade platform,” said Brad Chase, Head of Liquidity Products at Ripple.

Reduce Costs and Free Trapped Capital

Available 24/7/365, Liquidity Hub leverages smart order routing to source a variety of digital assets at optimized prices across multiple liquidity venues, including market makers, exchanges and OTC desks. These deep liquidity pools from multiple providers ensure liquidity is sourced when you need it—from USD to BTC, ETH, ETC, BCH, LTC, USDC and USDT.

XRP will be evaluated along with other tokens for support within the product. We look forward to supporting XRP as it receives regulatory clarity in the U.S.

By optimizing crypto pricing and liquidity across asset pairs, businesses can realize significant cost savings on high-volume transactions like treasury management.

Importantly, Liquidity Hub reduces the need to pre-fund capital positions to source liquidity or transactions within multiple venues, freeing up previously trapped capital that can be applied to other areas of your business.

Eliminate Complex Liquidity Management

This solution makes it easy to source and manage liquidity across several venues. And because it uses a streamlined API, businesses can get started on their crypto strategies without the intensive integrations and unnecessary investments of time and resources.

Once live, Liquidity Hub eliminates complex multi-venue management requirements by allowing businesses to access digital assets all in one place. Multi-asset, multi-venue sourcing also locks in optimized pricing and stability to shield businesses from market volatility and price swings.

The intuitive dashboard enables streamlined managing, trading and reporting of transactions to further simplify digital asset management. This simple, user-focused approach helps companies avoid having to build teams of crypto experts, affording more time, budget and headcount.

“Liquidity Hub offers both usability and interoperability, helping teams quickly and easily get started and then manage the assets that drive their business,” said Chase.

Power An Interoperable Future

Liquidity Hub is an integral part of Ripple’s commitment to helping businesses unlock immediate, real-world value through crypto and blockchain.

At its core, it allows for seamless bridging between traditional fiat and crypto assets. Paired with Ripple’s broader suite of products, Liquidity Hub enables businesses to optimize crypto liquidity and tap an extensive network of global payout rails to streamline crypto transactions, treasury management and other applications.

Its streamlined API and simple, intuitive design make it easy for customers to deploy and manage. And its ability to execute real-time trades around the clock with a minimum number of re-quotes or slippage all while meeting a high bar for security and regulatory standards provides peace of mind for any business.

Ripple Liquidity Hub is a purpose-built platform for enterprises that confers a critical business advantage in a crypto-first future.
