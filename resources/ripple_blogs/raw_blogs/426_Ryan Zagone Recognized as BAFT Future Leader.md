The Banker’s Association for Finance and Trade (BAFT) launched a program in 2016 recognize future leaders in transaction banking. BAFT developed the Future Leaders program in response to a growing need to reinvigorate interest in transaction banking as a profession, while engaging a generation of leaders in issues affecting the entire banking industry.We are pleased to share the news that our Head of Regulatory Relations Ryan Zagone has been included in this year’s BAFT Future Leaders Program. Zagone also serves on the Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee. In 2016, VP of Global Sales and Client Relations Nilesh Dusane participated in the inaugural year of the program, and Ripple is excited to continue our company’s involvement.

“I am honored and pleased to build on Ripple’s engagement with BAFT and its esteemed members,” said Zagone. “There’s such an awesome task before us in updating vital banking processes, and putting the best of fintech innovation to work. BAFT has been instrumental in building those partnerships, and I am humbly pleased to contribute.”

Nominations for this year’s group were considered by the BAFT Board of Directors, which includes executives from the biggest banks in the world: HSBC, J.P. Morgan, Standard Chartered, and BBVA.

“Last year, we launched this program to identify and develop the next generation of leadership in transaction banking,” said Tod Burwell, president and CEO of BAFT. “The program was met with an overwhelmingly positive response from the participants, their sponsoring institutions and our broader membership. This year, we have expanded the program and will have four project teams addressing current industry issues with a fresh perspective from the next generation of industry leaders.”

Zagone’s project group, which includes bankers from CBA, BNY Mellon, and JP Morgan, will present on fintech and its applications in transaction banking at the BAFT Global Annual Meeting. As in 2016, Ripple is the only solutions provider included in the program.
