As tokenized assets and stablecoins gain momentum, financial infrastructure must evolve to support seamless movement across blockchain networks. Institutions increasingly demand digital assets that can move securely and efficiently, without added complexity, risk, or liquidity fragmentation.

To help meet this demand, Ripple is expanding XRPL’s multichain capabilities. As part of this effort, Wormhole, one of the leading cross-chain interoperability protocols, is integrating with both the XRP Ledger (XRPL) mainnet and the XRPL EVM Sidechain. This integration will enable cross-chain messaging, asset transfers and multichain issuances of tokens which will support additional use cases across DeFi, institutional on-chain finance, and real-world assets (RWAs).

Wormhole enables over 200 applications spanning 35+ blockchain ecosystems. It supports institutional products like tokenized assets and stablecoins, facilitating over 1 billion cross-chain messages and more than $60 billion in cross-chain volume, since its inception in 2020. Major institutions such as BlackRock, Securitize, and Apollo use Wormhole’s services. Its integration follows other key interoperability initiatives across the XRPL ecosystem, further illustrating the XRPL’s commitment to optionality and composability.

XRPL is purpose-built to support open financial infrastructure and institutional applications. Its architecture enables developers and financial institutions to choose from a growing set of infrastructure providers. With support from interoperability protocols like Axelar and now Wormhole, XRPL empowers builders to expand their applications across ecosystems, without compromising on speed, cost, or compliance.

Ripple’s support for Wormhole reinforces this open approach, ensuring the XRPL ecosystem remains flexible, composable, and multichain-ready.

Wormhole will integrate its cross-chain messaging infrastructure with both the XRPL mainnet and the XRPL EVM Sidechain, enabling developers to:

This integration brings new optionality for developers and institutions looking to build cross-chain applications whether for payments, DeFi, and RWA use cases. It also builds on XRPL’s strengths as a decentralized blockchain for on-chain finance, offering native support for tokenization, liquidity provisioning, fast settlement, and compliance-focused infrastructure.

“By integrating Wormhole into the XRP Ledger, we’re helping unlock even greater potential spanning all major blockchains for one of the most established blockchain networks in enterprise finance—further advancing its role as a foundation for regulated, interoperable digital asset ecosystems,” said Robinson Burkey, Co-Founder of Wormhole Foundation.

“If you want real mass adoption, interoperability is essential. The infrastructure has to be there, not just on one chain, but across them. With this integration, tokens natively issued on the XRP Ledger are being set up for that reality by being able to move between blockchain networks while maintaining native issuance, and control. And with support from infrastructure like Wormhole, we’re broadening cross-chain capabilities across XRPL and its EVM sidechain—extending the network’s reach without compromising the reliability it was built on,” said David Schwartz, CTO of Ripple and Co-creator of the XRPL.

The future of on-chain finance relies on breaking down blockchain silos to enable secure and efficient movement of assets across networks. Ripple’s collaboration with Wormhole further strengthens this, supporting institutions and developers as cross-chain innovation evolves. This latest integration underscores XRPL’s long-term vision: to enable a robust, open, and multichain ecosystem for regulated financial applications. With support from a growing number of infrastructure contributors, XRPL is well-positioned to support the next chapter of institutional blockchain innovation.
