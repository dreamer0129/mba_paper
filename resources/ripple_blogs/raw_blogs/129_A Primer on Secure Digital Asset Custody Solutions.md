As digital assets continue to become further integrated in the global financial system, the need for secure digital asset custody solutions has never been more pressing. Most global finance leaders plan to deploy custody solutions within the next three years, and each will require robust, scalable security frameworks to protect against evolving threats. Ripple Custody provides a bank-grade solution designed for those seeking the highest levels of security, compliance and operational efficiency.

A crypto custody solution provides the foundational infrastructure for the secure management of digital assets, enabling a variety of use cases like offering customers the ability to make payments with stablecoins, becoming a crypto custodian, or trading tokenized real-world financial assets like stocks and bonds. The stakes for how best to achieve secure crypto custody are high—digital asset adoption is surging, with 10% of the world’s assets expected to be tokenized by 2030, fueling a projected $16 trillion industry within the same timeframe.

To begin, a financial institution (FI) holding digital assets must choose one of two paths to protect their portfolio: a custodial or non-custodial solution.

Custodial solutions place control of private keys in the hands of a third-party—typically a crypto exchange, fintech provider or bank. The FI may choose to outsource their custody needs for convenience, additional security layers, or to access other services offered by the provider such as crypto on- and off-ramps.

In contrast, non-custodial solutions give the asset holder full control of private keys but also place the responsibility of private key protection solely on the user.

Crypto custodians can range from traditional financial institutions to specialized fintech firms, provide security, regulatory compliance and streamlined asset management. Unlike traditional custodians that physically hold and protect assets, digital asset custodians secure the cryptographic private keys that grand access to those assets. This is achieved through a combination of technologies like cold storage, hardware security modules (HSMs) and user-defined governance policies. Without these protections, institutions risk exposure to hacks, lost funds and regulatory non-compliance.

The primary purpose of a crypto custody solution is to provide the infrastructure for securing digital assets, even as threats evolve and become more sophisticated. Threats can arrive on many fronts; phishing scams, social engineering attacks and compromised credentials are pervasive risks, with fraudulent websites, fake support teams and malicious software all able to deceive users into sharing private keys or authentication details.

The consequences of inadequate protection can be catastrophic. The recent Bybit exchange hack resulted in $1.46 billion in stolen digital assets, making it the largest hack in crypto history. A Chainalysis breakdown of the case revealed the hackers used social engineering to manipulate a third-party’s user interface, tricking authorised signatories into signing a fraudulent transaction and granting the attackers access to key assets.

These risks can be exacerbated by the popularity of new tokenized financial products like spot crypto ETFs that present additional considerations for custody providers. These investment vehicles require secure custody of the underlying asset while still maintaining liquidity and market activity for investors. Inadequate key management can hinder trading efficiency or expose digital assets to vulnerabilities.

A well-designed custody strategy will balance accessibility with security to ensure seamless operations without compromising protection of the private keys. A multi-layered security and governance framework might include multi-signature authentication (to require multiple approvals for transactions); options for hot, warm, cold or air-gapped wallets; a choice for cloud-based or on-premise custody solutions; and either Hardware Security Models (HSMs) or Multiparty Computation (MPC) as private key protection standards.

As part of designing a security framework and deploying a custody solution, FIs must identify and address critical areas of vulnerability. Strong governance, technical integration and compliance with evolving global regulations are all non-negotiable elements of a secure crypto custody strategy.

No matter how strong a provider’s security practices are on the technical side, human error will always be a risk in both traditional and decentralized finance. Social engineering scams and phishing attacks can exploit lapses in employee training, making it imperative for institutions to enforce rigorous security education and access controls.

Compliance through regular audits and documentation is important for providers and institutions to take into consideration in order to understand how their location and technical choices impact compliance efforts. For example, some jurisdictions require the use of a cold vault and on-premise implementation of HSM solutions.

Institutions must also decide whether to build their own custody solutions or partner with an established technology provider. While in-house solutions may offer customization and control, they require significant technical expertise, regulatory acumen and ongoing investment. Partnering with a custody technology provider can accelerate time to market, ensure adherence to best security practices and reduce operational overhead.

Finally, asset holders should confirm that their custody technology provider has built-in redundancies to mitigate single points of failure—centralized risk in a custody provider can be just as risky as inadequate security. End-to-end secure architectures and operating models that remove any single points of failure can provide further technical assurance, and help eliminate the potential for human error.

Self-custody in crypto is all about control—the holder takes on full responsibility for storage and management of private keys. This approach is ideal for an institution that wants to build and operate their own custody solution. It allows the institution to integrate the technology with existing infrastructure and align with their unique operational and security requirements.

Institutions seeking a self-custody solution often prioritize features such as:

Self-custody offers unmatched privacy, control, and flexibility. When executed effectively, it can enable institutions to offer new business models and financial services like becoming a custodian or issuing a stablecoin. It’s important to note that these institutions must also meet the appropriate regulatory requirements to offer digital asset services.

Choosing the right custody technology provider requires evaluating a range of factors, from security infrastructure to regulatory compliance. A key distinction lies in how providers manage private keys—either through HSMs or MPCs—each addressing different use cases, security preferences, scalability and accessibility.

HSMs are tamper-proof physical hardware devices or cloud-based modules that are designed to securely store private keys. Their strength lies in their physical isolation, making them the gold standard for securing assets in offline, long-term storage or in environments with strict regulatory requirements.

In contrast, MPC makes it difficult to steal an asset by cryptographically splitting private keys into multiple “shards” that can be distributed across secure locations.Its software-based nature allows for fast, automated, and highly scalable key management, making it well-suited for high-frequency trading and online, "hot wallet" operations.

Technical expertise is another critical consideration. The level of internal resources required to manage a solution depends on the provider and the institution's specific needs, regardless of whether it's HSM- or MPC-based. Institutions should choose a solution that best aligns with their risk tolerance and operational framework.

To help with their choice, institutions should deeply consider the reputation, track record and regulatory history of any third-party custody technology provider. Digital asset custody is still a relatively new industry segment, making due diligence essential. Assessing past performance, security certifications and compliance with global standards helps institutions mitigate risk and ensure long-term asset protection.

Ripple Custody provides institutions with a fully integrated, battle-tested custody platform designed for 24/7/365 secure asset storage, transfer and settlement. Trusted by global banks, including BBVA, SG Forge, DBS Bank, and DZ Bank, Ripple Custody offers a comprehensive solution that prioritizes security, compliance and seamless connectivity with digital asset markets.
