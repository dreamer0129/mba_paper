XRP’s rate of supply assuming 50% is used per month.“Within the $50 billion digital asset market, XRP has already grown tremendously in volume and market capitalization, and this pivotal development comes on the heels of Ripple’s significant customer traction with financial institutions. The lockup provides a level of predictability about XRP supply that is favorable for market demand,” says Spencer Bogart, Head of Research at Blockchain Capital.XRP is the only digital asset with a clear use case - it’s the best digital asset for payments. While bitcoin has virtually reached its limit to process transactions (and continues to decline in market share), XRP is faster, more efficient and more scalable. Designed for enterprise use, XRP can be used by financial institutions for on-demand liquidity for cross-border payments. Payment providers and banks using XRP will gain greater access to emerging markets and much lower settlement costs, and this is why we remain committed to increasing XRP liquidity and continued decentralization of its ledger."We partnered with Ripple because of their strength bringing financial institutions together. Ripple's lockup of its 55 billion XRP with a cryptographic supply schedule is a clear signal that they are serious about building and maintaining a long-term, healthy ecosystem for XRP based applications," says Mike Belshe, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Bitgo.To learn more about XRP, visit the XRP Portal.
