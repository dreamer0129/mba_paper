Imagine a world where transferring money across borders is as seamless as sending an email—instant, cost-effective, and reliable. While traditional financial systems are still grappling with delays, high costs, and frequent errors, blockchain technology is paving the way for a new transformation. At the heart of this change lies the concept of liquidity fulfillment, a crucial element in making near-instant cross-border payments a reality. But what exactly is crypto liquidity, and why should financial institutions care?

Crypto liquidity refers to the ease with which a cryptocurrency can be bought or sold without affecting its market price. High liquidity indicates a stable market with plenty of buyers and sellers, while low liquidity can lead to volatility and higher transaction costs. The importance of crypto liquidity cannot be overstated; it ensures smoother border transactions, reduces overall transaction costs, and enhances the reliability of the market. For anyone involved in crypto transactions, from traders to businesses, understanding and valuing liquidity is crucial.

While traditional financial systems have improved in terms of speed and reliability for cross-border payments, there are still significant issues that need addressing. Swift-based transactions, though faster than before, often leave users uncertain about the status and whereabouts of their money. Additionally, moving money during weekends, holidays, or outside traditional banking hours can still be challenging due to the unavailability of intermediaries to settle transactions during these times, which can delay the settlement process. This lack of transparency and occasional delays continue to pose challenges in an increasingly globalized economy.

At Ripple, we’ve scaled our liquidity capacity by expanding our network across 80+ payout markets and building innovative liquidity pathways to make the cross-border payments experience fast, affordable, and seamless. While the crypto market is growing rapidly, it is still significantly smaller than the global FX market, presenting a unique challenge that requires sophisticated methods to solve.

To achieve this, we aim to facilitate fast, on-demand settlements at the lowest cost while ensuring the best cross-border payments experience for our customers and partners. This includes making sure that liquidity is always available to meet demand, even outside of traditional banking hours. By leveraging blockchain technology, global payment transactions can achieve near-instant settlement at significantly lower costs by removing intermediaries. These cross-border payments are secured on blockchain ledgers, and unlike traditional methods, crypto transactions are not bound by banking hours or holidays, making it possible to move money anytime, anywhere.

Crypto and blockchain-based cross-border payments rely on sufficient liquidity to convert crypto into the destination’s fiat (i.e. local currency) or other cryptocurrencies. This liquidity is provided by retail and institutional market participants and can vary depending on the exchange, trading pairs, and time of day. For instance, the liquidity for crypto-fiat is lower than fiat-fiat, especially for emerging market currencies. Additionally, liquidity capacity tends to be lower on weekends compared to weekdays.

Macroeconomic events can impact the liquidity of both cryptocurrency and traditional markets by influencing market sentiment, regulatory landscapes, interest rates, and currency valuations. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, global economic uncertainty led to significant sell-offs in both stock and cryptocurrency markets in March 2020, causing temporary liquidity challenges. High trading volumes put pressure on exchanges, leading to larger differences between buying and selling prices and causing unexpected changes in transaction costs. This underscored how sensitive financial markets can be to broader economic events, highlighting the importance of robust liquidity management across all types of assets.

To ensure 24/7/365 on-demand cross-border settlements, Ripple is continuously innovating. Our approach includes:

Expanding the Network: We are increasing the number of ways to move value from point A to point B seamlessly by expanding our network of reliable, efficient, and trustworthy exchanges, bridge assets, and payout partners. This expansion enhances our global footprint and ensures robust liquidity.

Advanced Technology: We employ advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning models to determine the most efficient path for transactions. These models prioritize on-demand and quick settlement while optimizing transaction costs.

Ensuring Success: Our goal is to deliver a 100% payment success rate, facilitating a frictionless experience for our customers and partners.

Ripple's efforts to ensure liquidity have resulted in noteworthy benefits for customers, enabling smooth cross-border fund transfers with a near 100% success rate and significantly lower costs in comparison to conventional payment methods. Additionally, we are continually investing in increasing our liquidity capacity globally, alongside the broadening of payout capabilities in more than 80 countries worldwide.

This strategy for liquidity fulfillment is reshaping the global payments landscape. Through the use of blockchain technology, the expansion of Ripple’s network, and the integration of AI and machine learning algorithms, Ripple is enhancing the efficiency, affordability, and reliability of international transactions. With a dedication to achieving a flawless success rate and driving down expenses, Ripple is exceeding customer expectations, solidifying its position as a pioneer in the evolution of worldwide payment systems.
