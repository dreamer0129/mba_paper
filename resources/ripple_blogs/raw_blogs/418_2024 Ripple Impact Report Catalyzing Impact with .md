Team Ripple

The 2024 Ripple Impact Report marks our commitment to leveraging blockchain to drive meaningful change and foster economic mobility around the globe. In 2024, we launched bolder partnerships, funded more innovative solutions and empowered our employees to make a bigger difference.

This report highlights our most impactful moments, illustrating how we're using technology to connect communities and unlock potential on a global scale. We're proud to deploy our people, products, and resources to accelerate financial inclusion, broaden blockchain and crypto research, and give back locally.

Impact by the Numbers

Impact Finance Expanding financial services globally remained a priority for Ripple Impact in 2024 with new pilots and solutions built on XRP Ledger and leveraging the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin. We launched the Unlocking Opportunity initiative with Mercy Corps Ventures, a new humanitarian aid partnership with the International Rescue Committee and funded critical research with the Lab for Inclusive Fintech at UC Berkeley.

Blockchain Research and InnovationRipple's University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) continued to expand its global network, now supporting 60 leading universities worldwide. In 2024, UBRI welcomed four new partners and distributed $5.7M in funding.

Sustainability and Carbon Markets Ripple made continued progress toward achieving net zero as a company by or before 2030 and invested in proven nature-based carbon removal methodologies.

Employee Impact In 2024, Ripple employees made a greater impact than ever, with 80% participating in volunteering and giving programs. From mentoring job seekers in New York to packing reclaimed food in London and supporting young students in Bangalore, employees found meaningful ways to give back.

Global Philanthropy Ripple provided funding to over 70 universities and nonprofits last year. We joined the Pledge 1% movement and when disasters struck, Ripple provided XRP and cash donations to relief organizations like World Central Kitchen. In 2024, we gave $21M in grants, totaling over $200M in donations since 2018.

We are grateful to our partners and employees who made all of the progress and milestones in our 2024 Ripple Impact Report possible. We remain committed to leveraging our technology, resources, and network to create lasting, meaningful change.
