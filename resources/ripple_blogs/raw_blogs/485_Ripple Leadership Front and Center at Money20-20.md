Team Ripple

Ripple’s executives are on stage in force at this year’s Money20/20 USA to talk about improving global payments with blockchain and digital assets, and how these technologies can bring new value to businesses and consumers around the world.

Specifically, Executive Chairman and Co-founder Chris Larsen, Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, SVP of Business and Corporate Development Kahina Van Dyke and SVP of Product Asheesh Birla will all speak over the course of the event.

They’ll join over 11,000 attendees, including other C-suite executives, business leaders and media from over a hundred different countries at this marquee FinTech industry event.

Monday October 22nd: David Schwartz and Kahina Van Dyke

The Ripple executive team’s appearance at Money20/20 kicks off on Monday with David Schwartz taking part in a special “Oxford-style debate” moderated by Tony Hayes at 10:10 am PT. Schwartz will argue blockchain’s merits as the best solution to fix today’s broken international payments system, leaning on his deep knowledge of the space and his experience building Ripple’s products and technology. His opponent, Esther Pigg, the SVP of Product Strategy at FIS Payments, will defend the financial industry’s current approach to global payments and its reliance on legacy infrastructure.

Kahina Van Dyke will then take the stage later in the day, at 2:10 pm PT, as part of the exclusive Money20/20 Rise Up program. Van Dyke is being honored as a powerhouse speaker for the inaugural Rise Up class and will share key insights on stage about negotiation fundamentals and how it applies to leadership in all aspects of life. She’ll draw on lessons learned from more than 20 years of experience at Fortune 500 companies in banking and technology.

Tuesday October 23rd: Asheesh Birla

On the second day of Money20/20 USA, Asheesh Birla is a panelist in a session about blockchain’s impact on the cross-border payments industry. He will leverage his experience bringing Ripple’s products to market over the past five years — products that have made cross-border payments faster, cheaper and more transparent than ever before.

Birla will be joined on stage by Victoria Liu Edison, the Chief Compliance Officer for Americas at Ant Financial, the Head of New Technologies at Wells Fargo Dan Vogt and dLocal’s Co-Founder and CEO Sebastian Kanovich. The panel will be moderated by Brendan Miller, principal analyst at Forrester.

Wednesday October 24th: Chris Larsen

To close the event, Chris Larsen will participate in a candid fireside chat about the emerging significance of digital assets in the global economy moderated by Arjan Schütte, the founder and managing partner of Core Innovation Capital. Larsen has been a long-time advocate of financial inclusion and streamlining the movement of money globally.

Before co-founding Ripple, Larsen was the CEO of Prosper and E-Loan, driving the latter’s effort to be the first company to show consumers their FICO scores. At Ripple, he defined a mission based on the Internet of Value, to enable the world to move money like information moves today. Larsen will share what he’s learned over the years as both an entrepreneur and a business leader.

Update: Unfortunately, SVP of Business and Corporate Development Kahina Van Dyke was unable to participate on stage with the rest of the Rise Up class.
