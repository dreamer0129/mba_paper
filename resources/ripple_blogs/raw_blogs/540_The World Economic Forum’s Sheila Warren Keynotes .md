Today, the blockchain and digital currency industry is at an inflection point, similar to that of the internet boom of the 1990’s. Not unlike the internet’s historic impact, these technologies have the capacity to engender greater financial inclusion and economic opportunity. Will global policy makers provide thoughtful regulation that both fosters innovation and protects consumers? If not, what are the implications?

At Ripple Swell Global 2020, Sheila Warren—Head of the Blockchain and Digital Assets team at the World Economic Forum (WEF)—takes the stage in a fireside with Ripple’s SVP of Marketing, Monica Long, to address these questions. Warren will examine what it takes to design inclusively and with user protection in mind and how policymakers are thinking about digital currencies and blockchain technology today and tomorrow.

Warren understands first-hand the importance of discussion and clear policy frameworks to realize the transformative potential of these technologies—in a way that embeds ethics, inclusion and integrity into our increasingly connected, but often financially divided world.

At WEF, Warren focuses on community creation among regulators and central banks to encourage continued exploration and implementation of these technologies. As a first step, WEF’s Global Blockchain Council recently announced the creation of the “Presidio Principles” with the goal of aligning key stakeholders in a fundamental vision of how users can—and should—be protected as blockchain technology continues to develop. Discussions and projects like these are paramount as the industry advances.

Ripple’s invite-only conference goes virtual for the first time this year on October 14 and 15. Warren brings her expertise to the event alongside a bold roster of soon to be announced payments experts and industry luminaries to discuss trends, successful blockchain implementations and how today’s leading financial institutions are meeting growing consumer demand for better, more inclusive financial systems.

As the industry continues to mature and more real-world problems are solved through these advancements, Ripple Swell Global offers a virtual gathering to explore the potential impact and connect with industry thought leaders in an immersive, interactive environment.
