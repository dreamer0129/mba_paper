In a powerful step toward accelerating blockchain innovation in Asia, Ripple has partnered with the Web3 Salon project—supported by JETRO - Japan External Trade Organization and powered by the Asia Web3 Alliance Japan, a prominent Web3 startup ecosystem and strategic enabler in the region.

This new collaboration reflects a shared commitment to nurturing Japan’s digital asset ecosystem—an environment known for its deep technical talent, strong regulatory frameworks, and increasing appetite for innovation in financial services and tokenized assets.

As part of the partnership, Ripple will offer grant funding of up to $200,000 per project over the next year. This initiative is part of the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund and Ripple’s broader 1 Billion XRP commitment to provide financial, technical, and business support for developers and startups building on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The funding will be awarded to a select group of early-stage startups based in Japan that are building on the XRPL, particularly in use cases like decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized real-world assets (RWA), and digital payments.

Grant recipients will be selected based on their growth potential, technological sophistication, and alignment with Ripple’s investment priorities. Ripple will manage the grant process directly to ensure strategic impact and support. In addition to funding, startups will gain access to Ripple’s extensive network of global partners, experts, and customers. Learn more about eligibility at XRPL Grants.

While Ripple provides financial backing and ecosystem connectivity, Web3 Salon will take the lead on founder support—offering mentorship, workshops, and curated opportunities designed to help founders scale their ventures, refine go-to-market strategies, and connect with regulators and investors.

This initiative is more than just a grant program—it’s a multi-stakeholder platform designed to foster dialogue across public and private sectors. Whether through one-on-one coaching or open roundtables, the goal is to close the gap between traditional financial systems and the rapidly evolving world of blockchain innovation.

To amplify visibility and drive momentum, Ripple and Web3 Salon will co-host four major community events between now and March 2026. These gatherings will spotlight standout startups, explore policy trends, and bring together founders, regulators, and enterprise leaders.

The agenda includes:

Each event is designed to accelerate growth—not just for individual startups, but for the entire ecosystem.

Japan has long been recognized as a global leader in regulatory clarity and consumer protection. But its highly structured environment can also present hurdles for emerging startups and frontier technologies. By working together, Ripple and Web3 Salon aim to lower the barrier to entry and help startups navigate Japan’s complex but promising Web3 landscape.

“Japan is one of the most exciting and challenging markets for Web3 and blockchain adoption,” said Hinza Asif, President of Asia Web3 Alliance Japan. “Through this partnership with Ripple, we aim to support visionary founders and strengthen the bridge between global innovation and Japan’s tech landscape”.

With the support of JETRO - Japan External Trade Organization, we are also committed to engaging more fintech startups and helping them scale through blockchain technology.

Christina Chan, Senior Director of Developer Growth at RippleX: “Ripple is proud to collaborate with Web3 Salon to unlock new opportunities in Japan’s thriving startup ecosystem. Together, we hope to fuel innovation and support the next generation of leaders.”

This partnership signals more than momentum; it reflects a coordinated, global effort to bring institutional-grade infrastructure to one of Asia’s most forward-thinking economies. The initiative is proof that strong collaboration between public institutions, private companies, and builders on the ground can create real impact at scale.
