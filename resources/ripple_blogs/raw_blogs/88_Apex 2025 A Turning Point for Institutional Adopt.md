From stablecoins to tokenized treasuries, Apex 2025 showcased how XRPL is powering real-world finance at global scale.

Apex 2025 was more than a community summit, it was a milestone moment for the XRP Ledger. Held over June 10-12, the event brought together builders, researchers, institutions, and innovators from across the world to celebrate 13 years of progress and explore what’s next for XRPL.

With major product launches, insightful panels, and powerful institutional endorsements, the biggest Apex event to date at an all new venue signaled that blockchain’s moment in mainstream finance is no longer on the horizon, it’s here.

Ripple CTO David Schwartz and Head of Product at RippleX, Jazzi Cooper kicked off the event by reflecting on XRPL’s evolution over the past 13 years and laying the groundwork for what’s next, from stablecoins and tokenized RWAs to compliance-first programmability.

Next, HSBC’s Chief Digital, Data and Innovation Officer, Zhu Kuang Lee, joined Ripple’s Fiona Murray for a fireside chat on the role of blockchain in banking. Lee shared real-world use cases including tokenization across multiple asset classes and how HSBC is building institutional-grade digital asset custody infrastructure.

Ripple President Monica Long and CEO Brad Garlinghouse were then joined by Pat Patel, CEO of Global Finance & Technology Network Americas & MEA. The trio discussed global regulatory trends, the pro-innovation policy shift in the U.S., and why APAC is positioned to lead the next chapter of institutional blockchain adoption.

Day Two opened with a major announcement: Ondo Finance’s tokenized U.S. Treasuries (OUSG) are now live on the XRPL, with seamless minting and redemptions via Ripple’s enterprise-grade stablecoin, RLUSD. Ripple’s Monica Long and Ondo CSO Ian De Bode dove deep into the implications for institutional finance, and why Treasuries are leading tokenization adoption.

Later, Ripple’s Lauren Berta hosted a standout stablecoin panel with Michael Higgins (Hidden Road) and Leonard Hoh (Bitstamp by Robinhood). Together, they explored how RLUSD is unlocking real-world utility across global markets and how new stablecoins like USDC, EURØP, and XSGD on XRPL are transforming the payments and trading landscape.

Finally, David Schwartz and Mayukha Vadari closed the show with a forward-looking session on XRPL programmability, including multi-purpose tokens (MPTs), the new permissioned DEX feature, and future lending protocols. And yes, David now goes by Crypto Spice.

The Rise of Global Stablecoins on XRPL

Five new stablecoins went live: USDC, XSGD, EURØP, RLUSD, and USDB. Each brings region-specific utility, regulatory compliance, and fiat-backed credibility. These assets enhance liquidity and settlement options across continents and mark XRPL’s evolution into a global stablecoin platform.

Tokenized Treasuries with Ondo’s OUSG

OUSG now enables Qualified Purchasers to access tokenized U.S. Treasuries on XRPL 24/7, using RLUSD for settlement. This breakthrough unlocks programmable liquidity for capital markets and real-time access to one of the world’s safest assets.

Guggenheim Treasury Services Digital Commercial Paper Launch

In partnership with Zeconomy, we brought the first digital commercial paper (DCP), administered by Guggenheim Treasury Services on the XRPL. The fixed income asset secured by U.S. Treasuries is rated Prime-1 by Moody’s and is now part of XRPL’s growing institutional-grade RWA suite.

Ripple’s Web3 Salon Partnership in Japan

Ripple announced a strategic collaboration with Web3 Salon to support Japan’s next generation of blockchain startups. Backed by JETRO and Ripple’s Japan & Korea Fund, the program offers grants of up to $200K and ecosystem-wide support.

The conversations, launches, and energy at Apex 2025 all point to one thing: XRPL is becoming a backbone for institutional-grade finance.

From all new compliance-focused features and unlocking institutional use cases, to stablecoins and tokenized government bonds, the XRP Ledger is evolving to meet the needs of modern finance, without compromising its public, decentralized foundation.

With enterprise-grade features like Credentials, Permissioned Domains, Permissioned DEX, and Multi-Purpose Tokens on the horizon, XRPL is shaping up to be the go-to blockchain for tokenized financial infrastructure.

Running alongside Apex 2025 from June 10–12, UBRI Connect brought together global academic leaders from Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) for a series of dedicated events hosted at the National University of Singapore. The program welcomed 160+ members of the UBRI community—including researchers, faculty, and students—for panels, lightning talks, and technical demos focused on tokenization, stablecoins, post-quantum blockchain systems, and more. Attendees hailed from leading institutions like Cornell, UCL, and Berkeley, reinforcing UBRI’s global reach.

The event also featured a 36-hour XRPL hackathon, where 250 developers—from students to experienced professionals—competed to build the next wave of blockchain applications. Notably, 9 out of 10 finalists were student-led, and UBRI-affiliated universities claimed nearly half of the total prizes, including top awards for XRPL Mainnet deployments. UBRI Connect concluded with the annual UBRI Awards and a VIP dinner, offering a fitting celebration of academic excellence before participants joined the broader Apex community.

To the builders, partners, and supporters who made Apex 2025 possible, thank you. Together, we’re building a more open, efficient financial system, and the momentum we saw this year is just the beginning.

With record numbers in attendance at Apex 2025, we look forward to hearing where you’d like to see next year’s event take place!

Remember, you can catch up on all the announcements and sessions from Apex 2025 on-demand, and make sure to stay tuned for what’s next.
