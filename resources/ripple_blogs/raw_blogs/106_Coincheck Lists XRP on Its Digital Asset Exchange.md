Ripple is excited to announce that Coincheck, one of the leading digital asset exchanges in Japan, has listed XRP. By expanding access to buy, sell and trade XRP, exchanges like Coincheck increase its liquidity, foundational to making it an efficient bridge currency to financial institutions around the world.

Coincheck hosts 2,200 merchants and 40,000 individual users, 90 percent of which are located in Japan. The company, founded in 2014, currently processes $100 million in monthly bitcoin volume.

Adding XRP/JPY as a payment corridor through Coincheck helps increase XRP’s liquidity in the Asia-Pacific region. Financial institutions can choose to use XRP to lower liquidity costs in cross-border payments. By using XRP to service cross-border payments on demand, banks can reduce or eliminate pre-funded, overseas nostro accounts.

Financial institutions can save up to 60 percent in payment processing costs using Ripple’s solution and XRP. This cost-savings frees up capital to take advantage of new revenue opportunities and to access new corridors.

Notably, Coincheck listed XRP just one day after our CEO Chris Larsen and Product Manager Warren Paul Anderson met with their executive team, highlighting the industry’s enthusiasm for XRP and its institutionalization across the globe.

Coincheck’s addition of XRP adds to Ripple’s momentum in Japan. Other recent milestones include the launch of the SBI Ripple Asia consortium of 42 member banks, including Resona Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, as well as a pilot with Mizuho Financial Group, one of the first Japanese banks to trial blockchain technology for cross-currency settlement.
