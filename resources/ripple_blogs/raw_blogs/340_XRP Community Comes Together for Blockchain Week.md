## 核心内容

Team Ripple

At Ripple, we’ve always pledged our commitment to helping build XRP liquidity and a healthy and trusted market. Without question, we are huge fans.

XRP is uniquely set apart. Proven faster (seconds vs. minutes), more scalable (1,500 transactions per second) and less costly (fractions of a penny) than other digital assets, XRP is ideally suited for removing friction from global payments.

While we are laser-focused on furthering this specific use case, XRP is much bigger than Ripple. Recall that the XRP Ledger was created before the formation of Ripple and has always been and will always be an open-source project that exists independently of the company.

Like all open-sourced, decentralized technology — it’s powered by a growing community. XRP’s diverse community consists of financial institutions, exchanges, wallets, validators, educators, developers, market makers, enthusiasts, entrepreneurs and more.

Much of this group will be in New York City for Blockchain Week next month. As special thanks to those who are building liquidity, validating transactions, developing on the XRP Ledger, looking to xRapid as a liquidity solution and sharing the good word about XRP’s many benefits, we’re hosting a special night.

This VIP gathering will feature a live music performance by Snoop Dogg. While this is an invite-only event, we will offer 10 tickets via Twitter over the coming weeks.

Together, let’s raise a glass to celebrate the passion, focus and innovation of the XRP community and the revolutionary nature of the technology behind it!

How to Win

To win a ticket to XRP Community night, we invite you to participate in two @Ripple contests this month.

We ask that you carefully read and follow the rules for each contest to be eligible to win.

Please note this is a private event. Tickets can not be purchased, and we will limit admission to those on the invite list and our contest winners. Please note this does not include travel.
