Team Ripple

The Middle East has long been home to forward-thinking innovations across myriad industries and in recent years has solidified its role in the global economy as a leading adopter of crypto solutions for finance.

Ripple is the first blockchain-powered payments provider to be licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to bring its flagship cross-border payments solution, Ripple Payments, to businesses across the region.

This licensing milestone helps legitimize real-world applications of digital assets in the Middle East and will beget innovative financial services for institutions and retailers alike. Ripple is fueling this transformation by providing the trusted payments, custody and stablecoin solutions that banks, fintechs, and crypto businesses need to support and scale their digital asset strategies.

The Middle East has established itself as a crypto hotbed, driven by progressive regulation, technological advancements and a young, tech-savvy population. Already the world’s seventh-largest crypto economy, the region is poised for rapid growth as the home to several key fintech and crypto hubs and deep institutional and enterprise adoption.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has taken a proactive approach to crypto regulation, creating a stable and business-friendly environment that is attracting global blockchain leaders looking to scale and invest.

Broader sentiment toward digital assets in the Middle East is also overwhelmingly positive. Eighty-five percent (85%) of finance and enterprise firms in the region say their confidence in digital assets has increased in the last six months, and 97% believe digital assets will have either a massive or significant impact on business within the next three years.

As interest in this industry grows, so too does the demand for secure digital asset custody solutions. Ripple’s own research shows that 40% of finance and enterprise firms in MEA already use a digital asset custody solution, the highest adoption rate of any region surveyed. Another 56% plan to implement it within the next three years, underscoring the region’s appetite for institutional-grade digital asset solutions.

From Ripple’s 2020 Dubai office opening, to a growing global customer base of which 20% is located in the region—the Middle East remains a key focus in 2025 and beyond.

DFSA licensing approval allows Ripple to offer fully regulated cross-border crypto payments in the UAE. For businesses operating in the $400B trade hub, one of the world’s largest, and a $40B remittance market, this means expanded access to faster, more cost-effective and transparent international transactions.

Across the region—and the global payments ecosystem more broadly—demand for Ripple Payments continues to grow, with both crypto companies and fintechs turning to Ripple to help solve inefficiencies in traditional cross-border payments systems like high fees, long settlement times, and opaque transactions.

Ripple USD (RLUSD)—an enterprise-grade, USD-denominated stablecoin created with trust, utility, and compliance at its core—is now integrated to enable stablecoin payments for Ripple Payments customers. RLUSD also supports integration into DeFi protocols, allowing traditional institutions to safely and securely tap into opportunities in the digital asset ecosystem.

As the Middle East continues to set the pace for regulatory clarity and digital asset innovation, Ripple remains committed to supporting the region’s financial evolution with cutting-edge blockchain solutions.

With more than 60 licenses held worldwide, including approvals from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the New York Department of Financial Services and the European Union, Ripple is well-positioned to drive the next wave of enterprise blockchain adoption worldwide.
