VP of Data Matt Curcio shares his excitement for the road ahead both on the mountain and in crypto. Check out his thoughts on the benefits of risk.

## 核心内容

Team Ripple

Matt Curcio is not afraid of risk in his life. In fact, he actively looks for it and manages it both inside and outside of work. A self-proclaimed thrill-seeker, Matt spends his weekends in the mountains snowboarding in backcountry, invigorated by what’s waiting to be discovered around every corner.

Preparation for a day in backcountry is an extensive procedure. Safe snow levels? Check. Radios? Check. Safe avalanche report? Check. Gear? Check. Ensuring your backcountry team is on the same page? Check and check.

Applying this mindset to his role as VP of Data has enabled Matt Curcio to grow a synchronized team focused on helping build Ripple’s roadmap using concrete evidence. The team is constantly measuring where we are, where we’re going, how to get there, and refining the process along the way.

Similar to the unknown on the mountain, Matt explains that working at a fast-paced company requires risk tolerance and preparation for uncharted territory.

“You learn a lot when you’re slightly uncomfortable, and I think that’s a good place to be—especially when helping at work and especially in recreation.”

Data is inspiring to him, especially at a high-growth company like Ripple. He and his team have a lot of visibility into what’s being built, and that transparency enables them to productively collaborate and anticipate what’s next.

“It’s like going to backcountry—you never know what’s around the corner, but that’s why you’re there.”

The crypto and blockchain industry is evolving rapidly as new applications are built and adoption continues to expand. Matt makes sure his team is aligned on how their work will help achieve Ripple’s vision to build the Internet of Value through breakthrough crypto solutions for a world without economic borders.

“The great thing about Ripple is the vision that we have. It’s really about changing the future of finance, changing the way that people send value around the world,” Matt explains. “We talk about it being the third pillar of globalization, and being part of the company that can make that happen is really inspiring for me.”
