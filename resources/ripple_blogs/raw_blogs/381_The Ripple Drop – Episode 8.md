Team Ripple

Welcome to episode eight of The Ripple Drop, a web video series covering the latest news about the company’s customers, technology, products and culture.

This month we’re taking a look back at 2018 in a special holiday episode featuring SVP of Customer Success Marcus Treacher and SVP of Product Asheesh Birla.

First up, Treacher shares his views on the key milestones RippleNet had this year, including new customers, corridors and applications built with Ripple’s technology.

Then, Birla talks about Ripple products and specifically xRapid moving into production this year. He’ll also discuss what’s next for payments on RippleNet that use the digital asset XRP.

We’ll be sharing extended cuts of each of these segments shortly. We hope you enjoyed this episode, and let us know if there are any topics you’d like to see more of in the future.
