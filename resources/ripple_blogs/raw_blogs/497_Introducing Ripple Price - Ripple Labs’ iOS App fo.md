We’re excited to introduce the first iOS app produced by Ripple Labs - Ripple Price! Available for free in the App Store, Ripple Price offers real-time Ripple (XRP) prices based on popular currencies currently supported by the Ripple network.

By tapping a trading value, users can see XRP pricing in the given currency by Gateway, as well as 24-hour trading volume for the Gateway.

We’ll add more currency options to view over time. We welcome your requests, so please leave them in the comments thread! We’re also working on other mobile apps for Ripple, so stay tuned.
