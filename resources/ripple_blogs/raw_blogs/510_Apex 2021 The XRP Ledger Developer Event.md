Ripple announces Apex, the first-ever XRP Ledger developer conference, hosted in partnership with the XRP Ledger Foundation.

## 核心内容

Team Ripple

Since day one, RippleX has been dedicated to supporting the XRP Ledger (XRPL) developer community. As one contributor to the XRP Ledger’s success and maintenance, our team has introduced tools, services and programs that allow developers to more easily get started building applications and use cases that accelerate an Internet of Value, where value moves as easily as information does today.

Continuing upon this commitment, we are excited to announce that we are hosting the first-ever XRPL developer conference: Apex.

Hosted in partnership with the XRP Ledger Foundation, Apex is a new event where developers, contributors and thought leaders within the crypto industry come together to learn, build, share, network and celebrate all things XRP Ledger.

Why Attend?

Apex is a great way to get to know the XRPL community and share your ideas and projects being built on the XRP Ledger. This first-of-its-kind event will showcase XRPL use cases and projects, as well as the latest features and developments.

What’s more, Apex will feature thought leaders on stage and virtually—stay tuned for speaker announcements coming soon!

Ways to Join

The inaugural Apex will be hosted virtually and in person in Las Vegas and Tallinn, Estonia.

All developers—whether you’re a beginner, intermediate, or expert—are encouraged to join virtually. However, as space will be limited for the in-person events, interested attendees will be required to request an invitation.

Developers and XRPL community members can also apply to speak at Apex. Our call for speakers closes on August 13 at 11:59pm PST and seeks topics related but not limited to: tokenization (NFTs), smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), developer tooling and crypto use cases or projects.

To stay up-to-date on speaker and content announcements, follow @RippleXDev and @XRPLF on Twitter, or head to apexdevsummit.com.

Health and safety notice: We are monitoring public health guidance in relation to in-person events. We will continue to monitor and make any necessary changes as the situation evolves. If the in-person event needs to be cancelled due to guidance from public health authorities, the event will be held fully virtually.
