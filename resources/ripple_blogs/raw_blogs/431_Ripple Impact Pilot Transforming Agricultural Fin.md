Team Ripple

Ripple Impact is excited to announce the launch of our second pilot this year with Mercy Corps Ventures as part of our Unlocking Opportunity initiative. In collaboration with WËIA, this pilot is designed to increase financial inclusion and income for smallholder farmers in Colombia through blockchain-powered traceability on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

The agricultural sector in Colombia faces significant challenges, with over 86% of smallholder farmers operating informally without credit histories or transaction records. This lack of financial documentation creates substantial barriers to sustainability and financial inclusion. Currently, 79% of the rural population lacks access to credit lines, resulting in smallholder farmers earning only 70% of the minimum living wage and perpetuating cycles of poverty.

Buyers of agricultural products struggle to verify sustainability claims, an increasingly important consideration for end consumers. Industry data suggests that up to 10% of the global food system is affected by food fraud accounting for approximately $50 billion annually.

The pilot program integrates WËIA's blockchain traceability platform which was built on the XRP Ledger with innovative financial mechanisms to address these challenges:

Approximately 300 smallholder farmers will participate in the pilot, processing 240 tonnes of panela (unrefined whole cane sugar) monthly. Notably, around 46% of participating farmers are women, compared to the national average of 26%, highlighting the project's commitment to gender inclusivity.

The pilot aims to test three key hypotheses about the impact of XRPL-powered traceability:

This pilot offers a unique opportunity to demonstrate real-world applications of blockchain to improve traceability in agriculture, creating pathways for smallholder farmers to access financial services, improve livelihoods and ensure compliance with global sustainability regulations.

This program has the potential to establish a model for agricultural communities worldwide, bolstering financial inclusion and creating sustainable economic opportunity through transformative blockchain technology.
