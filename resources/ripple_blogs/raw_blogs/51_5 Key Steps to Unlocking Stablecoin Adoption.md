Stablecoin adoption is on the rise as the technology assumes an increasingly crucial role in digital finance. Total stablecoin market cap reached over $210 billion in January this year, with future trajectory showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon.

Pegged to stable assets like fiat currencies, these digital assets combine the reliability of fiat with the efficiency of decentralized finance. Their programmability and stability makes them uniquely equipped to address the growing demands of globalization, emerging markets and real-time cross-border payments.

However, unlocking the full potential of stablecoins requires more than technological advancement—it demands a robust regulatory framework to mitigate risks, ensure stability and facilitate growth.

With that aim in mind, Ripple recently partnered with StraitsX and the Global Finance & Technology Network (GFTN) to convene a public-private roundtable discussing the future of stablecoins, in particular fiat backed stablecoins, and how best to unlock their transformative potential.

Held at the GFTN’s by-invitation-only Insights Forum during the 2024 Singapore Fintech Festival, the discussion brought together stablecoin issuers, digital asset custody providers, international standard-setting bodies and regulators from the UK, Japan and Singapore. The roundtable discussions were also supported by a Stablecoin primer for issuers and users published by the Blockchain Association of Singapore (BAS), Ripple and StraitsX, which explores the types of stablecoins, stablecoin use cases, and their benefits and risks.

The discussions centered on how to scale stablecoin adoption in a sustainable and compliant way, and touched on critical issues ranging from regulatory frameworks to operational best practices and enterprise use cases.

Following the roundtable, Ripple consolidated the key findings into five essential recommendations for establishing a trusted and sustainable ecosystem for fiat-pegged stablecoins. Available now as an Insights Report, these strategies include:

Stablecoins are universally accessible and operate on inherently global technology, but their use and issuance remains subject to  locally regulated financial environments. To foster adoption, it’s essential that regulatory frameworks ensure consistency across jurisdictions while allowing for region-specific adaptations. International organizations like the Financial Stability Board and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) play an integral role in this effort by driving global collaboration on standards and best practices that enable responsible innovation, yet are flexible enough to accommodate local market dynamics. At the same time, these organizations can help local jurisdictions with limited regulatory infrastructure implement new standards for the effective and supervised utilization of stablecoins.

As stablecoin adoption and utility grows, stablecoin issuers must prioritize measures that support operational transparency and reliability. Events like de-pegging, where the stablecoin strays significantly from the value of its linked assets, substantially undermine user trust and market stability. To maintain a healthy and growing global stablecoin market, the roundtable recommended that issuers diversify banking relationships and payment rails; invest in technological resilience; and improve reserve management to ensure that stablecoins remain liquid, accessible and hold their value even in times of market stress. A focus on customer experience can also reinforce trust and set the stage for wider adoption. These operational best practices support the creation of a stable, scalable and compliant ecosystem that fosters innovation without compromising on safety.

In a rapidly evolving—or in some cases, absence of a clear regulatory environment—a compliance-first culture is a critical foundation to ensure stablecoin issuers can effectively build credibility and navigate regulatory uncertainties. This begins with self-regulation and governance structures that prioritize risk management and compliance. Proactive collaboration between industry bodies and regulators, such as the formulation of  frameworks like the FATF Travel Rule for secure customer data sharing, also demonstrates a commitment to responsible innovation. For issuers, this supports the global utility of stablecoins, as balancing global compliance standards with local regulations allows seamless operation across jurisdictions while minimizing the risk of enforcement actions. Ultimately, issuers should align compliance initiatives with broader industry goals that foster sustainable growth while maintaining safeguards against fraud and financial crime.

Like any other digital industry, stablecoins and other digital assets face the risk of cyberattacks, fraud and data breaches. This underscores the importance of strong enterprise custody frameworks, which adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) standards and offer features like cold storage and multi-signature controls. These additional layers of security can significantly reduce vulnerability to online threats. Interoperability with traditional financial systems is also important because it ensures that an enterprise can seamlessly execute compliant cross-border transactions within existing workflows. Solutions like Ripple Custody, or other custody services built for institutions, offer a fully integrated, secure and scalable platform that has been embraced by leading custodian banks, exchanges and corporates in over 15 countries.

Institutional adoption of stablecoins for applications such as cross-border transactions or treasury management hinges on creating an intuitive user experience that balances compliance with efficiency. The goal should be to integrate stablecoins without requiring end users to become experts on the underlying technology. This means building a compliance environment that is tailored to an enterprise’s specific use case and maintains familiar workflows for users. At the same time, it cannot be overly conservative as it may bog down operations and unnecessarily complicate transactions. And given the lack of universal accounting standards for stablecoins, issuers, accounting firms and regulators must work together to establish clarity and consistency in financial reporting.

It’s clear that stablecoins are poised to reshape finance by effectively bridging traditional and decentralized finance. But to fully realize their potential and transform global finance as  more efficient, interconnected and inclusive, stablecoins require clear and robust regulatory frameworks that can shield them from risks such as market disruption, security vulnerabilities and cross-border compliance issues.

The newly launched Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin embodies our commitment to responsible innovation and a modern global financial ecosystem. Regulated under the bank-grade New York's Limited Purpose Trust Framework, RLUSD addresses real-world use cases, including cross-border payments and liquidity management, with unparalleled compliance focus and transparency.

Working with industry leaders and regulators around the world, we can ensure stablecoins fulfil their potential, catalysing greater economic inclusion and efficiency in the future of finance.
