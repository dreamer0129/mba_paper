The countdown is on for Apex 2025 — the world’s premier XRP Ledger (XRPL) community summit — and this year’s speaker lineup is more dynamic and diverse than ever before. Held for the first time in Singapore, Apex 2025 brings together thought leaders, developers, innovators, and institutions from around the world for three days of breakthrough insights, global collaboration, and powerful community energy.

With over 80 speakers spanning blockchain pioneers, academic researchers, Web3 founders, and financial leaders, Apex 2025 is set to be a landmark event at the intersection of institutional DeFi, tokenization, stablecoins, and XRPL innovation.

XRPL is purpose-built for finance — and Apex 2025 sets the stage for how that mission is evolving. Get ready to hear directly from the leaders who are shaping the future of blockchain infrastructure and finance:

Brad Garlinghouse, CEO, Ripple and Monica Long, President, Ripple will take the main stage to explore the acceleration of institutional adoption — from stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets to APAC’s regulatory edge.

David Schwartz, Ripple CTO joins Jazzi Cooper, Head of Product, RippleX, to deep dive into how XRPL’s core features are enabling permissioned DeFi, programmability, and institutional liquidity.

Ian De Bode, Chief Strategy Officer at Ondo Finance, sits down with Monica Long to discuss tokenized treasuries, compliant yield products, and why institutions are migrating to open financial infrastructure.

One of the most highly anticipated sessions of the week — “Introducing the New XRPL Foundation” — will bring together leaders from Ripple, XRPL Labs, XRPL Commons, and XAO DAO to detail the foundation’s evolution, its new governance model, and how it will empower developers and community members to contribute to XRPL’s long-term growth.

Joining the discussion are Matt Mankins, Founder, XRPL Foundation, David Bchiri, Founder, XRPL Commons, Fabio Marzella, CEO, XAO DAO, Robert Kiuru, COO, XRPL Labs, and host Luke Judges, Partner Director, Ripple, who will share insights into the Foundation’s strategy, structure, and vision for the future.

This year’s full lineup reflects the truly global nature of XRPL’s ecosystem. From academic research to infrastructure development and startup innovation, Apex 2025 offers insights for every corner of the community.

Here are just a few of the standout speakers joining us in Singapore:

Apex 2025 isn’t just about listening — it’s about building. Whether you’re launching your first dApp, integrating stablecoins into your product, or exploring new developer features Apex is the place to connect, create, and collaborate.

Explore developer breakouts on topics like Multi-Purpose Tokens, ZK rollups, permissioned DeFi, and escrow programmability. Attend panels on tokenized real estate, market structure, and smart contract security. Or get inspired by lightning talks, live demos, and showcases from leading ecosystem projects.

Workshops. Announcements. Asia-first integrations. Community-first governance. This is Apex — the annual summit that defines where XRPL goes next.

Three days of learning, networking, building — and a lot of community celebration.

For the first time, Apex lands in Asia, and Singapore will serve as the vibrant backdrop for this landmark global gathering. As APAC continues to lead the charge in Web3 adoption, there’s no better time or place to join XRPL developers, enterprise leaders, investors, and blockchain pioneers for an unforgettable summit. With more than 80 speakers, key announcements, hands-on workshops, and access to the latest innovations in stablecoins, tokenized assets, DeFi, and compliance tooling, Apex 2025 will deliver the connections and insights that shape the next wave of blockchain-powered finance.
