Banks could generate $380 billion in annual revenues by leveraging financial inclusion opportunities in emerging markets in five years, according to a report by Accenture.

Of course, the existence of such a huge opportunity also speaks to how banks have traditionally shied away from targeting developing economies as compliance costs ramp up and the industry’s appetite for risk diminishes. The result is that huge swaths of the world remain unbanked.
