Team Ripple

Ripple and the broader XRP community are committed to introducing advanced programmability, including smart contracts, to the XRP Ledger developer ecosystem. This move aims to provide builders, entrepreneurs, and users with additional customizability for a variety of use cases, accelerating innovation and attracting developers looking to leverage XRP Ledger's expanded capabilities.

Programmability on the XRP Ledger will improve through two key developments: the introduction of native smart contract capabilities on the XRP Ledger Mainnet, which is currently in the research phase, as well as the introduction of the XRPL EVM Sidechain, expected to go live in the coming months. These advancements will complement each other to create a robust, versatile ecosystem capable of supporting a wide range of applications.

The XRP Ledger is renowned for its exceptional efficiency in transferring value, bolstered by a stable, secure and robust infrastructure. This is underpinned by a decentralized framework upheld by a global network of validators and a transparent amendment voting process to enable new layer-1 features.

Such features, including Escrows, NFTs, authorized trustlines, payment channels, and the DEX + AMM, provide a common set of composable primitives serving a variety of use cases. Combined with the low cost and high speed of the XRP Ledger, this makes the XRP Ledger well-suited for everything from traditional finance to innovative new applications in the digital economy. This growing suite of layer-1 enhancements are designed to optimize the pace of innovation and facilitate widespread adoption among developers.

While the XRP Ledger’s amendment process allows for careful, collectively-driven updates and provides a secure approach to introducing new widely applicable features, this leaves a gap for developers who need to handle the bespoke needs of their business – but don’t want to drive broad community adoption for something that may be niche. The upcoming smart contract functionality will offer additional flexibility for these developers by enabling permissionless development in a way that complements the functionality of amendments.

Existing smart contract standards, such as Hooks from XRPL Labs, lay an important foundation that can be iterated upon to enhance Mainnet capabilities. This framework allows developers to leverage the Ledger’s core strengths while using smart contracts to customize functionalities to meet specific needs, streamlining development and fostering innovation.

Some of the main considerations for Mainnet programmability are:

Ripple, in concert with the XRP Ledger developer community, will evaluate the best way to meet these requirements on Mainnet and publish an XLS proposal for broader review.

Progress towards smart contract functionality is already underway in the XRP Ledger ecosystem with the XRPL EVM Sidechain, developed in collaboration with Peersyst and nearing live deployment on the Devnet. This momentum is set to accelerate further in early 2025, marking a significant year for programmability on the platform. This sidechain will bring Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility to the XRP community, allowing developers to employ familiar tools and programming languages, thereby broadening the XRP Ledger’s appeal to a global developer community.

A key feature of the XRPL EVM Sidechain is its ability to leverage Axelar as the bridge, facilitating seamless transactions between the XRPL EVM Sidechain, the XRP Ledger, and over 55 other blockchains. This setup allows dApps to utilize both XRP Ledger features and EVM smart contracts concurrently. Wrapped XRP (eXRP) serves as the native asset and gas token, ensuring secure and efficient cross-chain transactions.

These dual advancements address the common needs of institutional DeFi users and developers, while empowering them to tailor solutions to their specific business or dApp requirements. Ripple and the broader XRP community are committed to nurturing a platform that not only advances in technology but also empowers developers and businesses to create revolutionary applications.

Developers familiar with EVM programming languages are invited to explore the possibilities offered by the XRPL EVM Sidechain. Moreover, in the journey towards enhanced Mainnet programmability, we are eager to collaborate with dedicated DeFi developers and encourage community input on design specifications. There are numerous opportunities for you to get involved:
