In emerging markets, it’s the people — many times children — who have the cards stacked against them, whether it’s being left behind by the current financial, education or healthcare systems.

That’s why, today, we’re excited to kickstart a month-long campaign in partnership with non-profit Raising Malawi to raise funds for orphans and vulnerable children across the southeast African country. From July 30 through August 31, Ripple will match all public donations in support of the cause and help individuals sponsor children directly through Facebook.

“We’re honored to be a part of Raising Malawi’s amazing work with some of the world’s most underserved children and are grateful to our investors at Sound Ventures for making the introduction to us and this important cause,” said Eric van Miltenburg, SVP of Business Operations at Ripple.

Nearly one million children in Malawi have lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDs, leaving them orphaned or without anyone to care for them.

Since 2006, Raising Malawi has served these children — more than 10,000 — through direct healthcare services and educational support, including materials, classes and funding scholarships. Raising Malawi has also helped establish the first pediatric surgery and intensive care unit in the country.

The non-profit was founded on the belief that vulnerable children deserved more than to “just survive.” It works with local partners on the ground to create opportunities for children to learn, grow and transform their futures.

Ripple and its executive team care deeply about giving back and eliminating barriers that keep marginalized populations from being a part of our global community. This means fostering programs for financial inclusion, improving access to fundamental human services, empowering teachers and supporting primary education, and promoting environmental literacy and conservation. This recent donation to Raising Malawi is just one such example of how we invest in causes that exemplify this philosophy.

With your support, we can help Raising Malawi provide critical healthcare services and educational opportunities for children across the country. Learn how you can sponsor a child today and become part of this important campaign.
