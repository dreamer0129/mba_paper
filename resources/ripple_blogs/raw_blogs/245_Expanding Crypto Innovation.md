Team Ripple

A New Era of Global Finance

Since Ripple’s inception in 2012, our vision has been to enable the Internet of Value — a world where money moves as seamlessly as information. In the realm of cross-border payments, we’re accelerating that vision to meet the new shape and identity of global finance so that our customers can thrive in this new environment by taking advantage of a modern infrastructure that moves money like never before.

Our unique solutions can eliminate pre-funding and free up working capital so our partners across a global network can reach key corridors quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, RippleNet employs a single rulebook to govern members of the global network, which ensures transparency and minimizes inefficiencies, redundancies and confusion. As a result, RippleNet members enjoy reduced operational overhead and simplified product deployment.

Through RippleNet, our customers and their end users can reap the benefits of blockchain technology — making it faster and less expensive to move money across borders. And this drives greater competition in the United States and abroad, catalyzing even more efficiencies in the global financial system.

“We are proud to be the first bank in Asia to use Ripple’s leading blockchain network solution to power real-time payments for our customers, whose families oftentimes depend on the availability of these funds for basic needs — time is of the essence to them.” — Dr. Arak Sutivong, Chief Strategy Officer at Siam Commercial Bank

After nearly a decade of continuous, rigorous upgrades and improvements to our suite of products, we’re one of the leading enterprise blockchain companies in the world, serving hundreds of customers across 55+ countries. Today, banks and financial institutions can dramatically improve the speed, cost and reliability of how people transact around the world.

Ripple Named to 2021 CNBC Disruptor 50 List

Earlier this year, CNBC revealed the 2021 Disruptor 50 Companies list and we were honored to be included as a recipient of the prestigious nomination for innovators in tech for the second consecutive year. As an organization, we’re extremely proud to be part of a group of innovative companies that are pushing the boundaries, challenging status quos and setting new standards. Across a number of years, that has meant creating a streamlined global payment network that empowers both financial institutions and their consumers.

Applying Our Expertise to Tokens

And while we continue accelerating our innovation in global payments and building a global network, we’re also driving breakthroughs in tokenization. That’s because better and more efficient means of tokenizing value will enable all kinds of assets — from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more — to be easily issued, used, exchanged and moved across what we call the Internet of Value.

We believe this is only the beginning for NFTs and for the broader category of tokens on the blockchain. To further empower entrepreneurs looking to utilize NFTs, we partnered with Mintable — an NFT marketplace that allows users to seamlessly create, buy and sell digital items using fiat or cryptocurrency.

With its native decentralized exchange (DEX), low transaction fees, fast transaction times, and carbon-neutral footprint, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is ideally suited to deliver a seamless experience for NFTs. Together with Mintable, we believe NFTs will enable new business models for creators, and offer new and better experiences for consumers.

“Accelerating the growth of this creator economy starts with an infrastructure that removes the barriers to entry — such as high gas fees and environmental costs of creating NFTs — faced by many today.” — Monica Long, GM, RippleX.

From financial institutions to developers and entrepreneurs, everything we do at Ripple is geared towards creating innovative solutions that contribute to realizing the Internet of Value. We’re using technology that can drive new business advantages for our partners, new benefits for consumers, and greater inclusion and equity for the unbanked and underbanked. We’re honored to be recognized for this innovative work, and we’re excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead.
