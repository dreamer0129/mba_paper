Each quarter we’ll be going under the hood with professors from Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) to gain a deeper understanding of trending topics in crypto and blockchain, and highlight their insights and key takeaways. The views expressed in this blog are solely those of Professor Hyunok Oh, based on his individual expertise and personal insights.

In our latest UBRI On Campus interview, we had the opportunity to speak with Professor Hyunok Oh from Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea. His pioneering work in the Security and Privacy Lab focuses on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and their potential to revolutionize blockchain technology. With South Korea being one of the fastest-growing markets for cryptocurrency adoption, education plays a crucial role in sustaining this growth and addressing emerging challenges. Here, we delve into his insights on ZKPs, their real-world applications, and the transformative impact of UBRI on academic and industry collaboration.

At the Security and Privacy Lab, Professor Oh's team is dedicated to advancing the practical applications of ZKPs. Their research aims to bolster privacy within blockchain systems across various domains, such as voting systems, financial identity verification, supply chains, and content trading. By improving security measures and transaction speeds, their work seeks to make blockchain technology more efficient and scalable, paving the way for broader adoption and innovative use cases.

Professor Oh's fascination with ZKPs began during his studies in theoretical computer science. Recognizing the profound societal impact of ZKPs, he pursued further research in this area, eventually finding blockchain technology to be an ideal platform for implementing these proofs. This discovery led him to focus on developing secure and private blockchain applications, blending his expertise in cryptography with the burgeoning field of blockchain.

One of the lab's standout projects is Harisa, an efficient membership proof designed to accelerate ZKP proof generation. This architecture has led to tailored research addressing practical challenges and developing solutions that are not only theoretically sound but also practically viable and impactful in the real world.

In the financial sector, Professor Oh's team has applied ZKPs to enhance anonymity and anti-money laundering measures for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Their groundbreaking work includes a published paper on a ZKP-based digital wallet system, Azeroth, which has now been built into a mobile digital wallet application. Notably, Azeroth the mobile app won the Innovation Award in Cybersecurity and Privacy at CES 2023.

Additionally, their zkVoting application received the Best of Innovation Award at CES 2023/24 and was recognized by CTA’s president Kinsey Fabrizo as one of the top solutions addressing global challenges at the CES opening ceremony. The Korean National Election Commission (NEC) has adopted zkVoting's core technology for national blockchain voting. Another upcoming publication, zkLogis, focuses on supply chain applications and is nearing commercialization, further showcasing the lab's impact across diverse sectors.

Professor Oh emphasizes the crucial role academic institutions play in the development and standardization of blockchain technologies. Given the rapidly evolving nature of blockchain, academic research can take innovative and high-risk approaches that private companies might avoid. The open-source ethos of blockchain allows academic findings to be seamlessly integrated, driving the technology forward through pioneering and validating new ideas.

Ripple's UBRI initiative serves as a vital link between academia and the blockchain industry. Since partnering with Hanyang University, UBRI has supported the development of pioneering research in ZKPs and their practical applications.

UBRI bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation, enabling academic researchers to explore innovative solutions that address real-life problems. This synergy ensures that academic insights remain grounded in practical applications, benefiting both academia and the blockchain industry.

UBRI has provided Professor Oh's students with unparalleled international exposure and a deep understanding of global blockchain trends. This initiative has equipped students with the knowledge and skills to address real-world problems, fostering a new generation of blockchain innovators. The opportunity to engage with a broader community and learn from leading experts worldwide has been invaluable for their academic and professional growth. The UBRI initiative has profoundly influenced the research and development efforts at Hanyang University's Security and Privacy Lab. By providing a clearer understanding of industry needs and the importance of privacy, UBRI has helped tailor their research to address practical challenges. This alignment has led to solutions that are not only theoretically robust but also practically viable and impactful in real-world applications.

Professor Hyunok Oh’s work at Hanyang University exemplifies the transformative power of zero-knowledge proofs in advancing blockchain technology. Through Ripple’s UBRI, his research is bridging the gap between academic exploration and industry application, driving innovation and shaping the future of secure and private blockchain systems.
