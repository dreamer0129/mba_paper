Team Ripple

Today’s economies are increasingly global. The advent of new technology has transformed the standardization, speed and cost of the transportation of goods and information exchange. Yet, financial services and the exchange of value remains unreliable, slow and expensive.

Ripple is changing this status quo. Through our robust suite of products and services, we’re eliminating the friction inherent in our global financial system—enabling payments for everyone, everywhere.

To accelerate our efforts, we are appointing new executive leadership across the organization, building out our global engineering team to support our growing number of customers in more places—and refreshing our brand to better match our obsession with streamlining today’s financial system.

RippleNet offers a distributed financial network combined with financial solutions, to move money with the same speed and standards that information moves today—removing the barriers ingrained in financial services for hundreds of companies. This powerful network delivers financial solutions like payments and liquidity management that were once only offered by multinational banks—without the cost and overhead of legacy systems.

By leveraging distributed ledger technology (DLT) and the digital asset XRP as the universal asset for value exchange, RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service allows customers to reduce, even eliminate, the need to pre-fund accounts.

To expand on these offerings, RippleNet GM, Asheesh Birla, and Ripple’s growing engineering team—including VP of Engineering Vidya Mani—are continuing to deliver services that enable customers to easily accelerate business performance and scale.

RippleNet’s competitive advantage will come to life at Ripple Swell Global. The event unites RippleNet customers, partners and industry leaders who are committed to changing the way money moves globally.

The key to achieving complete industry transformation is removing the pain and friction that comes with integrating blockchain technology into businesses and applications. By providing resources and tools, RippleX—formerly Xpring—along with the broader XRP community, are moving the needle to build trust, utility and liquidity in the digital asset XRP.

RippleX GM, Monica Long, leads the team working with the growing community of businesses and developers building real and sustainable solutions with XRP and the XRP Ledger. The characteristics of XRP and the XRP Ledger—superior speed, low cost, scalability and sustainability—allow developers and entrepreneurs to seamlessly transform existing applications and unlock entirely new user experiences across payments, identity, foreign exchange, digital media and more.

To enable a world where value moves as easily as information moves today—a concept we refer to as the Internet of Value—we need to rebuild the current legacy systems and the foundational infrastructure they run on. But real change happens when we think beyond ourselves.

Ripple Impact, formerly called Ripple for Good, partners with mission-driven organizations to create greater economic fairness and opportunity for all—through research, education and philanthropy. In concert with the University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), Ripple Impact is a natural extension of Ripple’s products and services. Ripple’s global payment solutions and initiatives are helping transform how vulnerable populations, remitters and small businesses worldwide send and receive money across borders.

Ripple is building upon an incredible opportunity that comes with realizing the Internet of Value. This opportunity improves today’s broken financial system for the larger purpose of financially strengthening the lives of millions of underbanked people around the world—by removing the barriers to economic equality and technical innovation.

Embracing social causes is built into our mission and company vision. If you’re interested in driving real change, we’re hiring.
