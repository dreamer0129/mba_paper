The stablecoin market is expected to reach a high of $3 trillion in the next four years. As the role of stablecoins in global finance becomes increasingly more pronounced, Ripple is announcing its plans to launch a stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar (USD) and backed 100% by US dollar deposits, short-term US government treasuries, and other cash equivalents.

While talk of stablecoins may seem like another phase of buzzworthy crypto news, this particular digital asset can add major value as an entry point for legacy financial systems to connect to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), ultimately driving a wave of new use cases. Additionally, leveraging a trusted, enterprise-grade stablecoin alongside XRP in Ripple Payments will support greater liquidity and enable global on/off ramps to service cross-border payments demand at scale.

The stablecoin market has reached about $150B, but the diversity of stablecoin issuers is still lacking. The global financial system is experiencing a unanimous increase in demand for stablecoins that offer real-world value centered around utility, liquidity and trust.

The move to issue a USD-backed stablecoin, alongside a compliance-first approach to building a superior cross-border payments solution, has positioned Ripple as a solid bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, where others offer tightropes.

“Institutions entering this space are finding success by partnering with compliant, crypto-native players, and Ripple’s track record and resiliency speak for itself as we launch new products and acquire companies through multiple market cycles,” said Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO.

For some time now, Ripple has leveraged a combination of assets — including XRP, fiat, and stablecoins — in the flow for Ripple Payments in order to provide the best experience for its global customers. In emerging markets, there’s demand for stablecoin payouts in lieu of the local fiat currency. Leveraging this stablecoin and XRP will improve the overall payments experience for customers around the world.

In parallel, the XRPL ecosystem has sought out a credible stablecoin to unlock new opportunities for institutional and DeFi use cases across a variety of industries.

“The XRP Ledger’s native capabilities, including a decentralized exchange and automated market maker, were built to utilize XRP as the bridge asset. Bringing a trusted stablecoin onto XRPL will drive more adoption and development, contributing to a vibrant ecosystem,” shared Monica Long, Ripple President.

The core benefits of Ripple’s stablecoin include:

By leaning into the capabilities that this digital asset provides, like increased liquidity and further improving the customer experience, Ripple can continue to solidify its role as the leading provider of enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions.
