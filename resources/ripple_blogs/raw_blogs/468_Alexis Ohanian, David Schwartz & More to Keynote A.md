## 核心内容

Team Ripple

Today, we’re thrilled to announce the keynote speakers for Apex, the inaugural XRP Ledger (XRPL) developer summit hosted in partnership with the XRP Ledger Foundation.

Alexis Ohanian, Founder, Seven Seven Six

Seven Seven Six founder Alexis Ohanian will take the stage in Las Vegas on Sept. 29 for a fireside chat with Ripple GM Monica Long. With firsthand knowledge fostering digital communities as the co-founder of Reddit, Alexis believes blockchain can do just that in the same way we saw with the internet—and we couldn’t be more excited to have him at Apex.

David Schwartz, Co-Creator, XRP Ledger

One of the most respected voices in the crypto community, David Schwartz (aka “JoelKatz”) will take the stage at Apex to share his thoughts on the continued evolution of the XRP Ledger. As one of the original architects of the XRPL and now CTO of Ripple, David is no stranger to the developers, projects and features that make the XRPL what it is today: fast, energy-efficient, and built to support tokens of all kinds.

Wietse Wind, BDLF, XRPL Labs

Having already established a successful career in programming, Wietse Wind discovered the XRP Ledger in 2016 and was excited by its efficiency, accessibility and on-ledger functionality—including its built-in DEX. From there, he began developing code and tools for the XRP community and by 2019, founded XRPL Labs through which he publishes open-source libraries and consumer applications on the XRPL.

Monica Long, GM of RippleX, Ripple

At Ripple, Monica Long leads RippleX—which provides technology, programs and services to developers building on the XRP Ledger. Monica has been instrumental in driving the institutional payments use case and working with the growing developer community to support more use cases for XRPL in this role. She’ll be kicking off Apex to give the opening keynote, as well as the closing keynote on Day 2.

XRPL Developer Spotlight

Apex attendees will hear directly from the developers, validators and projects contributing to the growing XRPL community such as Thomas Silkjær of xrplorer, Dr. J Scott Branson of Cabbit Technology and Enej Pungerčar of GateHub. Open-source projects funded through the XRPL Grants program will also take the spotlight, giving attendees a first look at the winners and honorees.

Join the XRPL Community at Apex

The two-day celebration of all things XRP Ledger will cover topics related but not limited to: tokenization, smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi) and developer tooling. Whether you’re a beginner, intermediate, or expert, all developers are encouraged to join virtually. Developers wanting to attend in-person in Las Vegas or Tallinn will be required to request an invitation by September 10, 2021 as space will be limited.
