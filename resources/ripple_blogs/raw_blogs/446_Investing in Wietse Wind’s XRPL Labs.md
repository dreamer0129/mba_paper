## 核心内容

Team Ripple

At Xpring, we are focused on growing the ecosystems around the Interledger Protocol and XRP Ledger. To do so, we need to work with developers that share our vision of interoperable blockchains and new use cases for XRP.

One of those developers is Wietse Wind. Wietse not only has excellent past experience, but understands the protocols and technical details of both the XRP Ledger and Interledger Protocol.

Wietse is also a leader in the XRP community, where he has dedicated personal time and resources to building projects and developer tools, contributing to the XRP Community Blog, and educating developers at local meetups. Wietse is a proven entrepreneur and has successfully grown his companies organically. He has built a technology consulting company, which serves numerous clients ranging from larger scale companies to smaller offices. He’s also built and ran a software company that provided a platform as a service for rapid web development.

We are thrilled to announce that Xpring has invested in Wietse Wind’s XRPL Labs. His creative approach, leadership and ability to engage developers were key differentiators in our decision to invest. He continues to stand up new products and projects while asking hard questions about how new technologies will enable new forms of engagement between people and machines (such as streaming payments for electrical power; see below). The funding will enable Wietse to dedicate more time and resources to his projects, which he will independently select. To see the latest announcements, follow Wietse.
