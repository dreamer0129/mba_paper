Team Ripple

In October, we announced a partnership with BitPay, the world’s largest crypto payment processor, to natively support XRP, which will enable thousands of businesses to accept XRP for payments through BitPay’s merchant processing platform.

Today, BitPay launched support for XRP and announced eGifter and CareUSA among the first merchants to accept XRP as a payment method upon launch.

eGifter is an innovator in the digital gift card space and was one of the first to start accepting Bitcoin when Bitpay launched several years ago.

CareUSA is one of the oldest humanitarian aid organizations in the world, and now accepts tax-deductible donations made in XRP.

Both organizations look forward to welcoming XRP adopters to their community of users.BitPay used libraries maintained by the Xpring team to integrate XRP into their platform, which in addition to its online merchant processing platform, also supports brick-and-mortar retail payments and global payments for billing.Each use case combines the speed, security and low cost of using XRP to settle payments.We look forward to supporting BitPay as a partner as they continue to grow with XRP.
