Team Ripple

Today, Ripple is excited to announce two new appointments to its leadership team. Rosa “Rosie” Gumataotao Rios, 43rd Treasurer of the United States, joins the Ripple Board of Directors and Kristina Campbell joins as Chief Financial Officer.

“These two exceptional leaders join Ripple at a pivotal time for the company,” said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO, Ripple. “Rosie’s experience in the public and private sectors provides an invaluable perspective to Ripple, especially during this time as the industry works to define crypto’s future. As well, adding Kristina’s extensive knowledge and success building teams and processes at rapidly accelerating businesses was a no-brainer. We are extremely fortunate to have them on the team as we continue our rapid international growth and to champion for regulatory clarity in the U.S.”

Rios brings 30 years of unparalleled experience and expertise in public policy and investment management to crypto solutions company Ripple. Her career has focused on economic development, urban revitalization and real estate finance. As the 43rd Treasurer of the United States, she oversaw all currency and coin production activities with almost 4,000 employees and an annual budget of $5 billion. She also initiated the efforts to place a portrait of a woman on U.S. currency and received the Hamilton Award - the U.S. Treasury’s highest honor.

“I’ve dedicated my career to financial inclusion and empowerment, which requires bringing new and innovative solutions to staid processes. Ripple is one of the best examples of how to use cryptocurrency in a substantive and legitimate role to facilitate payments globally,” said Rios. “Blockchain and crypto will underpin our future global financial systems. Cryptocurrency is the what. Ripple is the how.”

Campbell will drive Ripple’s financial strategy, accelerate growth and deliver value to shareholders as business momentum continues to grow globally for the crypto organization. Her strategic vision, combined with a focus on building fantastic teams and operational excellence, has resulted in significant successes for the businesses she's worked with throughout her career. Previously, she was CFO at PayNearMe, where both the business and team grew substantially under her leadership. Prior to Ripple, she held several roles at GreenDot, a now $2.5B public fintech company, including GM of GoBank.

“Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology allow us to rethink and improve the systems and infrastructure around how money moves. With this technology, we will make the global financial system accessible to all,” said Campbell. “Ripple is uniquely positioned to improve global payments in ways that have yet to be defined and I’m excited to be a part of that solution.”
