Team Ripple

Welcome to episode seven of The Ripple Drop, a web video series covering the latest news about the company’s customers, technology, products and culture.

In this episode, we’re taking the show out of the building with a visit to OMNI’s headquarters to talk to the company’s Founder and CEO Thomas McLeod. McLeod gives us the rundown on OMNI’s vision and how he and his team have integrated the digital asset XRP onto their platform.

Next up, we speak with SVP of Xpring Ethan Beard to learn more about the initiative. Beard discusses Xpring’s future plans to help support developers and businesses working on the XRP Ledger and Interledger Protocol.

Finally, Ripple’s Head of XRP Markets Miguel Vias talks about how new use cases for the digital asset impact broader global liquidity of XRP.

We’ll be sharing extended cuts of each of these segments shortly. We hope you like this episode, and let us know if there are any topics you’d like to see more of in the future.
