Welcome back for the second episode of The Ripple Drop, a web video series covering the latest news about the company’s customers, technology, products and culture.

On the first segment this week, we’re talking Kahina Van Dyke, Ripple’s new SVP of business and corporate development, about why she joined and how removing friction from global payments can change the world for the better.

Next, we sit down with Jinal Surti, Ripple’s director of business operations, to discuss the University Blockchain Research Initiative. He provides updates on how this select group of schools from around the world are training the next generation of blockchain entrepreneurs, developers and researchers.

Our final segment will feature Asheesh Birla, Ripple’s SVP of product. Asheesh previews his new monthly newsletter called BUIDL that will focus on the most interesting and impactful products and offerings in the blockchain space. Follow Asheesh for more on how to sign up for BUIDL before it goes live next month.

We hope you enjoy this episode and as always let us know via comments who or what you’d love to hear about in the future.
