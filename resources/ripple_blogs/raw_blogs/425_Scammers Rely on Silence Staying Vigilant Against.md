The holidays bring moments of connection—family gatherings, shared meals, and more time spent online searching for gifts and deals. Unfortunately, they also bring an uptick in scams. Fraudsters know people are busy, distracted, and often feeling generous this time of year, making the season a prime moment to target unsuspecting victims.

This year, the Tech Against Scams Coalition (TASC) is launching Scamberry Pie, a holiday initiative designed to start conversations about scam red flags. Scamberry Pie helps break that silence by making scam education approachable, memorable, and rooted in the moments where people naturally gather.

“Education is one of the strongest tools we have to protect people from scams,” said Dennis Jarosch, SVP Engineering at Ripple. “When people know what to look for, they’re better equipped to help themselves, and each other. Scamberry Pie creates a simple moment for families and communities to talk openly about warning signs, share experiences, and look out for one another.”

How to Spot a Scam: Key Red Flags

As scammers become more sophisticated, it’s critical to slow down and verify before acting. Here are common signs a crypto-related message, post, or offer may be fraudulent:

In some cases, scammers proactively contact individuals on social platforms while posing as legitimate figures and others use AI-generated voice cloning or deepfake videos. For additional details and to confirm official Ripple corporate and executive accounts, please visit the link here.
