Team Ripple

In early 2019, Xpring announced its investment in XRPL Labs, led by Wietse Wind, as part of a broader effort to support companies and projects building on the XRP Ledger.

Today, we are announcing an additional investment in XRPL Labs to support the continued growth and development of its Xumm Wallet & Platform, which Xpring believes is one of the best representations of the XRP Ledger.

The Xumm Wallet & Platform allows individual users and developers, respectively, to manage XRP Ledger accounts, as well as send, receive, and store XRP —including issued currencies (IOUs) on the XRP Ledger— in a non-custodial way. Xumm also recently added support for PayID to help the app scale to support other payment networks.

Together with his team, Wietse’s energy, creativity, and enthusiasm for building things on the XRP Ledger has helped to catalyze a growing community of developers around a shared passion and vision for building the Internet of Value using XRP.

We look forward to watching Xumm, and the XRP community that’s supporting it, grow to new heights with this funding.
