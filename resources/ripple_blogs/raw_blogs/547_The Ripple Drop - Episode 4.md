Welcome to episode four of The Ripple Drop, a web video series covering the latest news about the company’s customers, technology, products and culture.

On our first segment this week, Ripple’s Chief Market Strategist Cory Johnson shares the most significant finding in the Q2 XRP Markets Report. We also ask him what he’ll talk to Brad Garlinghouse about in his upcoming AMA later this week.

Next, we talk to Marcos Fernandez, senior manager for xRapid infrastructure partnerships. He tells us why last week’s announcement, xRapid Brings on Three New Exchange Partners, is so important for remittances from the U.S. to Mexico and the Philippines.

On our final segment, we sat down with Welly Sculley, director of business development. He discusses interesting trends he’s seeing among financial institutions on RippleNet.

We hope you enjoy this episode, and as always, let us know if there are topics you’d like to learn more about in the future.

An extended cut of this episode featuring the full interviews will also be available on Youtube. And, if you haven’t yet, make sure to catch up on episode one, two and three!
