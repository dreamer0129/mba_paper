Team Ripple

The stablecoin market is expected to surge to nearly $3 trillion in the next five years and will certainly reshape how value moves across the globe. While adoption of stablecoin-powered cross-border payments is increasing, philanthropy is emerging as a sector with untapped potential.

In a first-of-its-kind initiative, Ripple is primarily using fiat-backed stablecoin Ripple USD (RLUSD) to donate $25 million to leading education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach for America. It’s more than a pledge, it’s a blueprint for how stablecoins can unlock smarter, faster and more inclusive ways to support communities around the world.

The partnerships are already creating measurable impact. Ripple’s initial donation has now funded over 31,000 classroom projects on DonorsChoose, directly supporting more than 21,000 teachers across 13,000 schools.

At Teach For America, 2,500 new members across all 50 states will receive transition stipends, helping them reach nearly 300,000 students. The momentum extended beyond the donations at launch: U.S.-based Ripple employees personally funded 223 additional projects, and the work has only just begun.

The path to economic opportunity often begins in the classroom, but for many young Americans, that path is littered with roadblocks. Research has connected literacy to long-term earning potential, but many classrooms lack access to even some of the most basic tools that students and teachers need to thrive.

The scale of the challenge is clear. 89% of U.S. public schools have had at least one teacher request resources on DonorsChoose, and Teach For America’s network of educators will reach nearly 300,000 students across 40 underserved regions this year. Still, the demand for support in classrooms far outpaces the resources available.

Ripple’s $25 million donation aims to change that. The funding will support a number of high impact initiatives, including Teach for America’s Ignite tutoring program, a new national STEM Innovation Challenge, and already fulfilled thousands of classroom projects and teacher requests during Teacher Appreciation Week from May 5-9.

The donation will also support expanded financial literacy efforts, equipping students and teachers across the country with the knowledge and tools to succeed in a rapidly evolving job market. It’s a step toward rebuilding trust, restoring resources and reimagining what’s possible in American education.

Stablecoins have rapidly evolved into a cornerstone of digital finance, accounting for more than half of all onchain transaction volume in recent months. Their potential to streamline humanitarian aid, philanthropy and financial inclusion are just now being explored.

What makes stablecoins such a powerful tool for good? Stablecoin-powered transactions are fast, low-cost, highly transparent, and available 24/7. For nonprofit organizations, that means disbursing funds in real-time, reaching recipients directly and cutting down on administrative overhead. That’s true for both domestic initiatives and cross border payments—whether you’re funding a classroom in Kentucky or drought relief for communities in Kenya.

Stablecoins that are pegged to fiat currencies can help mitigate both crypto and local fiat currency volatility. This makes them especially valuable in communities with unstable banking systems or hyperinflation, where financial resilience is both urgent and elusive. And with an estimated 1.4 billion people unbanked and another 2 billion underbanked globally, stablecoins can unlock around-the-clock access to secure, affordable financial services with just an internet connection.

This education-focused pledge is part of Ripple’s larger mission to use crypto-enabled solutions to drive long-term, inclusive impact. Since 2018, Ripple has contributed over $200 million to nonprofits and universities worldwide.

To bring more resources to classrooms, Ripple is teaming up with The Giving Block—a platform that helps nonprofits accept crypto donations. That means organizations like DonorsChoose and Teach For America can now receive support in RLUSD and XRP, making it easier for people to give directly to educators and students. It’s a simple way to connect crypto innovation with real impact and efficiently move funds to where it’s needed most.

“At The Giving Block, our mission is to equip nonprofits with the tools they need to seamlessly accept crypto donations—so when companies like Ripple are ready to give, the infrastructure is already in place,” said Pat Duffy, co-founder of The Giving Block. “We’re proud to partner with Ripple to empower nonprofits like DonorsChoose and Teach For America with the tools they need to fundraise in the digital age.”

The Giving Block has been a driving force behind crypto philanthropy by making it easy for nonprofits to accept and convert digital assets to fiat. Ripple and The Giving Block are frequent collaborators, most recently teaming up for California wildfire relief. Their platform simplifies on-ramping and off-ramping, so organizations can focus on making a difference without worrying about the details. The Giving Block now accepts RLUSD in addition to XRP for crypto donations.

Stablecoins will become an increasingly important tool for philanthropy, proving they are both an innovative financial instrument and a force multiplier for good. In 2022 and 2023, stablecoins were the most donated type of cryptocurrency on The Giving Block’s platform. Ripple’s own RLUSD donation helps highlight the efficiency, transparency and reach this digital asset can bring to philanthropic giving.

As more nonprofits, donors and communities embrace blockchain-powered solutions, the future of doing good looks faster, fairer and more financially inclusive than ever before.
