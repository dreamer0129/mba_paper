Team Ripple

Ripple has invested nearly $4 billion into the crypto ecosystem through strategic investments and acquisitions. But 2025 marked its most ambitious year yet, with four major acquisitions all pointing toward one mission: to be the one-stop infrastructure provider for moving value the way information moves today.

The strategy is straightforward but sweeping in its impact. Ripple is delivering a complete, end-to-end payments stack, backed by enterprise-grade digital asset services that give institutions everything they need to engage in, benefit from, and scale with the onchain economy.

Some acquisitions will plug directly into Ripple Payments to give customers a unified, seamless operating environment with even more capabilities and currencies. Others will operate independently while benefiting from shared infrastructure. Together, they bring Ripple closer to owning the full financial plumbing behind global value movement, which means our clients have access to the full suite of digital assets capabilities that make their business faster, more efficient, and future-proof: custody, liquidity, payout networks, treasury management, prime brokerage services and real-time settlement.

As we enter 2026, businesses are operating in real time, but their financial infrastructure still isn’t. Ripple’s unified offering gives companies the ability to bring their money management and movement up to the expectations of the digital world. Ripple’s newest acquisitions are critical to powering that change.

GTreasury: Enterprise Treasury Intelligence

Ripple’s now-closed $1B acquisition of GTreasury marks a significant expansion into the multi-trillion-dollar corporate finance arena, a market many predict will lead the next phase of digital asset adoption. Faster settlement, better liquidity visibility, and the ability to move large-value payments around the world in real time are critical opportunities for corporate finance.

GTreasury, now a Ripple solution, will enable its enterprise customers the option to access digital asset infrastructure that can meet the speed and complexity demands of modern treasury operations. Through access to the global repo market via Ripple Prime and Ripple Payments’ real-time, 24/7/365 cross-border rails, corporate treasury teams can unlock idle capital, move money instantly and open up entirely new growth opportunities.

GTreasury has more than 40 years of experience supporting some of the world’s largest and most sophisticated companies. Integrating its treasury command center into Ripple’s technology stack gives corporates the ability to move, manage and optimize liquidity in real-time, across traditional and digital assets, under one expanded umbrella.

Rail: Virtual Accounts and Stablecoin Payments

The company’s $200M acquisition of Rail will make Ripple Payments the market’s most comprehensive end-to-end stablecoin payments solution, compliantly connecting the best of fiat and digital assets so that businesses can move money faster, save costs, and build to grow.

With virtual accounts, automated back-office capabilities and intelligent payout routing, Rail simplifies everything from corporate collections to global treasury flows. Rather than requiring customers to hold stablecoins or maintain specialized crypto bank accounts, the addition of Rail allows businesses to make pay-ins and pay-outs across key corridors entirely through Ripple’s unified platform. It supports a variety of digital assets, can price large-value transactions competitively and operates 24/7/365 through a single API for streamlined onboarding.

With Rail, Ripple Payments will give businesses one seamless system for moving value globally without operational overhead or added complexity.

Palisade: High-Speed Digital Asset Custody

The acquisition of Palisade broadens the range of customer use cases for one of Ripple’s central product strategies: custody. Palisade’s “wallet-as-a-service” technology extends Ripple Custody’s inherent appeal to banks and financial institutions to include fintechs, crypto-native firms and corporates that carry out high-frequency transactions.

The technology will be integrated into Ripple Payments to enable rapid money-movement scenarios such as subscription payments or collection capabilities—securely provisioning wallets at scale, signing transactions in milliseconds and sweeping funds cleanly into operational accounts.

Using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and zero-trust architecture security features in combination with fast wallet provisioning, multi-chain support and DeFi integration, Palisade’s performance profile supports use cases where assets must be mobilized quickly. In combination with the institutional-grade platform that global banks are already utilizing, the acquisition of Palisade makes Ripple Custody the optimal end-to-end provider for any digital asset strategy.

Ripple Prime: Institutional Liquidity and Execution

Ripple Prime, formerly Hidden Road, completes the liquidity and execution layer of Ripple’s one-stop shop vision. Ripple Prime offers institutional-grade prime brokerage, clearing and financing, enabling institutional clients, including those in the U.S., to execute OTC spot trades across dozens of major digital assets, including XRP and RLUSD.

Where Palisade custodies assets and Rail moves them, Ripple Prime ensures they can be traded efficiently, financed responsibly and accessed through regulated channels. It adds the institutional sophistication that enterprises expect when entering larger-scale or more complex digital asset markets.

Demand for digital asset support by institutional customers is tangible—Ripple Prime’s business has grown 3X since the acquisition was announced. Ripple Prime will also leverage blockchain to streamline its own operations and optimize costs.

A Unified Infrastructure for the Future

Each of these acquisitions—custody, virtual accounts, treasury intelligence, prime brokerage services—adds a critical capability to Ripple’s suite of solutions. But the real story is the sum of these parts: Ripple is building the one-stop infrastructure shop that will power the next era of real-time global finance.
