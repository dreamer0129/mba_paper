Real-world use cases for crypto and blockchain continue to be proven out—from tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), CBDCs and stablecoins, to crypto-enabled payments and beyond. As the industry continues to grow and scale, so too does Ripple, and it’s imperative that forward-thinking, innovative leaders are at the helm.

To that end, Ripple is excited to announce today that Warren Jenson is joining its Board of Directors. A seasoned CFO and operations leader, Jenson brings decades of experience in business at today’s most recognizable companies including Amazon, Delta Airlines, NBC, Electronic Arts and Nielsen to Ripple as the company continues to expand its presence in global markets. Jenson has also been appointed as the Chair of the Audit Committee, the coalition of independent experts overseeing the formal auditing process of Ripple’s operations.

“Ripple is in the midst of unprecedented scale, and Warren's background will be invaluable as Ripple continues to be a responsible global leader in the space,” said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO, Ripple. “Transparency and accountability are core pillars of Ripple’s operations; as an established CFO with operational knowledge across a variety of sectors, Warren’s unique expertise and experience as a transformational leader will be an incredible resource guiding our next steps for broader adoption of Ripple’s offerings from customers around the world.”

For more than three decades, Jenson has managed the financial operations for companies driving innovation as leaders in their respective sectors having most recently been named Chief Financial Officer of Nielsen. In addition to his position with Ripple, Jenson serves on the Board of Directors for DigitalOcean and Jobcase. He brings his passion for innovation and leadership to the National Advisory Committee for the Marriott School of Business at Brigham Young University as well as the Board of Leaders for USC’s Marshall School of Business.

“Throughout my career, I’ve been fortunate enough to join iconic companies driving transformative change in their respective fields, which is why I’m excited to join Ripple at a pivotal time when cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies are increasingly becoming integrated into financial services,” said Warren Jenson. “For cryptocurrency to successfully deliver on its potential to revolutionize traditional financial infrastructure, companies in the space must prioritize transparency. I’m excited to bring my experience to the company and share Ripple’s commitment to upholding the highest standards.”

On Ripple’s Board of Directions, Jenson joins other esteemed leaders including Former Treasurer of the United States Rosie Rios, Former JPMorgan Chase Chief Regulatory Affairs Officer Sandie O’Connor, and Managing Director of Albright Stonebridge Group Michael Warren.

Looking ahead, the future is bright for the Internet of Value and the broader industry at large. With the right partners, customers, and people in place, the opportunities for crypto and blockchain are endless.
