Ripple is proud to announce the addition of 10 new customers to our growing global network. These financial institutions include MUFG, BBVA, SEB, Akbank, Axis Bank, YES BANK, SBI Remit, Cambridge Global Payments, Star One Credit Union and eZforex.com, representing some of the world’s largest banks, innovative smaller banks, and payment service providers (PSPs). As the only blockchain provider that has real use cases and customers using our solution commercially, more and more customers are turning to Ripple for cross-border payments.

“The world’s largest banks have been the first to adopt Ripple’s technology, and the network effect from our customer base is accelerating,” said Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. “People know Ripple is the only blockchain solution for payments that is proven in the real world, and it’s driving demand from financial institutions of all kinds and sizes because they want to stay ahead of the curve.”

Here are just a few examples of how this new group of customers are using Ripple to significantly reduce the time and cost associated with global transactions:
