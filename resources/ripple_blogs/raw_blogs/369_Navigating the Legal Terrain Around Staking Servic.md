Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, XRP and others operate on a blockchain - a decentralized ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers (nodes).

While Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism to reach consensus on the state of the network, which requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles using a lot of computer power and energy to add a new block to the blockchain, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus chooses the creator of a new block in a different way. In PoS, the creator of a new block is chosen based on their “stake” in the cryptocurrency, meaning how many coins they possess and are willing to “lock up” as collateral.

When you stake your coins, you’re basically locking them up in a wallet to maintain the network’s operations by validating transactions and creating new blocks. In return for validating transactions and proposing new blocks, you can earn ETH as rewards.

The idea behind PoS and staking is to provide a more energy-efficient mechanism to maintain the network compared to PoW, and to incentivize honest behavior among participants by having them put their own assets at stake. This means they have a vested interest in correctly validating transactions since they have something to lose. It’s a way of ensuring that the people who are validating transactions and creating new blocks are invested in the continued accuracy and security of the blockchain.

The legal treatment of staking services and the rewards earned with staking internationally is now in the limelight. Admittedly, understanding such new technology and its legal and regulatory implications is extraordinarily complex. The following clarifies the mechanics behind staking and highlights relevant considerations.

Let's look at staked ETH as an example. The Ethereum system consists of the execution layer and the consensus layer. Transactions from address A to address B or smart contract interactions take place on the execution layer. The consensus layer is responsible for things like block and attestation handling:

Staking itself is designed as a software service by operating the staking infrastructure, namely the validator node. From a regulatory perspective, “pure staking” services do not raise any issues. Since the staking provider is never in possession of any of the private keys to the address on the execution layer, there is no third-party custody over the cryptocurrencies. With the validator keys, the staking provider may only initiate the unstaking, i.e. the transfer of the ETH in the deposit contract on the beacon chain to the withdrawal address on the execution layer, which does not raise any regulatory concerns.

Staking services may include different types of ancillary custody services, which may have a regulatory implication depending on its set up:

A staking provider may act as custodian and require a license if he has the actual and exclusive power of disposal over the cryptocurrencies. Whether he has power of disposal depends on whether he holds the relevant private keys. If the staking provider is the only person holding the validator keys and the private keys of the withdrawal address, this qualifies as third-party custody and the staked ETH would fall into the bankruptcy estate of the staking provider in case of bankruptcy. If the staking provider holds only one of these two keys, or if he is not the only one holding the private keys to the withdrawal address, this would not qualify as third-party custody and the ETH would not fall into the bankruptcy estate of the staking provider in case of bankruptcy. Hence, he would not require a license.

The underlying digital assets custody technology and governance around key management therefore become crucial considerations.

If a staking model is designed in such a way that the staking provider has the actual and exclusive power of disposal of the private keys of the withdrawal address, it needs to be further analyzed whether the client’s assets qualify as so called “depository values”. The most intensely debated criterion in this regard is the obligation to keep the cryptocurrencies at the client’s disposal at all times during staking:

Staking providers must make an in-depth analysis of their services, all related processes and the contractual framework. They should initially ask themselves e.g. the following questions to enable an assessment of the applicable legal rules:
