Team Ripple

In October, we announced an investment in BRD, one of the oldest and most respected crypto wallets in the industry.

Today, BRD launched Blockset, a robust blockchain data integration platform offering a suite of tools for developers to build applications across multiple chains using a simple API.

As part of the launch, Blockset includes support for XRP, which will help enable more developers with access to the XRP Ledger as they build their applications.

Blockset uses XRP libraries maintained by Xpring to help reduce the complexity of integration.

Individually, many of us at Xpring have been users of the BRD wallet for several years and have always appreciated their commitment to open source software, security and great user experience, so we are excited to be a partner with them as they continue to build world class products for crypto.
