## 核心内容

Team Ripple

Ripple is excited to announce we have begun beta testing Ripple USD (RLUSD) on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum mainnet. This is a significant milestone and a step closer to bringing more high-quality assets to the XRPL, driving new opportunities, liquidity, and institutional use cases for users, developers, and applications. The mainnet version of Ripple USD is also available on Ethereum, with plans to expand to additional blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols over time.

Ripple USD is currently in its beta phase and is being rigorously tested by our enterprise partners. This phase is crucial for ensuring that the stablecoin meets the highest standards of security, efficiency, and reliability before it becomes widely available, and after receipt of regulatory approval. Consequently, Ripple USD is not available for purchase or trading at this time.

Until then, please be cautious of crypto scams which may exploit Ripple’s brand and purport to have early access to sell Ripple USD, which is not available at this time.

Contract addresses:

There is a clear demand for stablecoins that deliver trust, stability, and utility. Once RLUSD is available, Ripple will use both RLUSD and XRP in its cross-border payments solution to serve its global customers and dramatically improve their experience. With over a decade of building enterprise financial solutions, Ripple is in an ideal position to launch a stablecoin that addresses a market projected to grow to over $2.8 trillion by 2028.

Ripple USD is valued 1:1 to the US dollar (USD) and 100% backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US government treasuries, and other cash equivalents. These reserve assets will be audited by a third-party accounting firm, and Ripple will publish monthly attestations.

Ripple is committed to transparency and will keep the community updated on the progress of Ripple USD. We appreciate your patience and enthusiasm as we work towards making RLUSD a robust and reliable stablecoin for everyone. Together, we are shaping the future of digital finance.

Stay tuned for more updates and announcements regarding Ripple USD.
