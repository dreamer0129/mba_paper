Team Ripple

Swell by Ripple is the only event today where blockchain, finance and policy converge — a meeting ground for more than five hundred industry experts committed to changing the way money moves around the world.

Swell’s provocative program kicks off on day one with a keynote by President Bill Clinton. Leaders from global banks, including Banco Santander and Siam Commercial Bank, also take center stage to share how Ripple’s blockchain technology has opened up new opportunities in remittances around the world. Innovators in international payments — Cuallix IDT, InstaRem and BeeTech — end the day with sessions on topics ranging from cheaper and faster payments through RippleNet to digital asset adoption across the financial services industry.

Of note on day two, Amy Radin, author and Fortune 100 chief innovation officer, Ben Braybn, head of Level39, and Tokunboh Ishmael, chairwoman of the African Venture Capital Association and managing director and founder of Alitheia Capital, sit down to discuss how they embraced disruptive technology as part of their organizational ethos with moderator Ripple SVP of Business and Corporate Development Kahina Van Dyke.

In addition to the program, attending customers will be able to connect directly with one another to establish new corridors and services with RippleNet. A “lightning round” session is dedicated to giving attendees the opportunity to explore these partnerships.

Ripple’s Blockchain Innovator Awards at Swell 2018 will also honor customers. These awards recognize thought leaders and first-movers within RippleNet — the people and companies that are using blockchain to remove friction from global payments.

Finally, Ripple is throwing a special customer celebration featuring Counting Crows, the award-winning rock band from Berkeley, CA, on the evening of October 1st.

Swell 2018 brings customer and their stories to the forefront and helps create new connections among them. The future of global payments is being shaped and built by these outstanding companies and individuals.

The event is less than a month away. For more information, please visit the Swell website and stay tuned over the coming weeks for more updates.
