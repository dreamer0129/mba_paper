Team Ripple

We’re less than one month away from Apex—the inaugural event that brings together developers to learn, build, share and celebrate all things XRP Ledger. In partnership with the XRP Ledger Foundation, we’re pleased to announce additional speakers who will join Alexis Ohanian, David Schwartz, Wietse Wind and Monica Long at Apex.

Chris Jimison, CTO, Forte

As Chief Technology Officer, Chris Jimison is on a mission to unlock the next era of gaming rooted in community economics at Forte. Key to achieving this vision is crypto and open-source systems built on blockchain to build one frictionless experience for game developers everywhere. Join Chris to hear how Forte is transforming the billion-dollar gaming industry.

Briana Marbury, Executive Director, Interledger Foundation

The Interledger Foundation aims to build access to financial pathways around the world. As Executive Director, Briana Marbury is on a mission to expand the public’s understanding of the Interledger Protocol – an open payments standard – and its immense potential to advance financial inclusion for roughly one-quarter of the world’s unbanked population.

Stefan Thomas, CEO, Coil

Stefan Thomas is an open-source developer and distributed systems advocate. As the founder and CEO of Coil, Stefan is building a better business model for the web using the XRP Ledger and Interledger Protocol, which he helped to co-create. You won’t want to miss Stefan as he takes the stage on Sept. 30 for a fireside chat with Ripple CTO David Schwartz.

Scott Chamberlain, Entrepreneurial Fellow, Australian National University

A longtime researcher, Scott Chamberlain is behind Lex Automagica: a tech stack automating legal processes at ANU’s College of Law. Join Scott for a preview into his latest venture, Evernode, which aims to bring permissionless, Layer-2 smart contracts to the XRP Ledger and incentivize anyone to run a decentralized application (dApp) at scale.

XRPL Feature Spotlight

Apex attendees will also enjoy deep dives into the functionality that makes the XRP Ledger scalable and sustainable—and the global developer community behind it. Tune in to learn more about Hooks, the XRP Ledger’s built-in decentralized exchange (DEX) and proposed features such as federated sidechains and native NFT support.

You can register to attend the two-day celebration of all things XRP Ledger virtually here.

Health and safety notice: We are monitoring public health guidance in relation to in-person events. We will continue to monitor and make any necessary changes as the situation evolves. If the in-person event needs to be canceled due to guidance from public health authorities, the event will be held fully virtually.
