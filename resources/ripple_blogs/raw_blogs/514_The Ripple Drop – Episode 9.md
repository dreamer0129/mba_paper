Welcome to episode nine of The Ripple Drop, a web video series covering the latest news about the company’s customers, technology, products and culture.

Kicking off the new year this month, our show features Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, Co-Founder and CEO of InstaReM Prajit Nanu and Ripple’s Director of Talent Jim Chauncey-Kelly.

First up, Schwartz discusses the XRP Ledger and what he sees as the most important changes over the past year.

Next, Nanu talks about InstaReM’s use of RippleNet and how the network benefits both his company and his customers.

Finally, Chauncey-Kelly shares some key job openings at Ripple’s offices around the world.

We’ll be sharing extended cuts of each of these segments in the coming weeks. We hope you enjoyed this episode, and let us know if there are any topics you’d like to see more of in the future.
