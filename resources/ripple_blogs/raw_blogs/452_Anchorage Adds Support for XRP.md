Team Ripple

In October, we announced our next chapter for Xpring as an open developer platform for payments and included a list of new partners to the XRP community. Among that list was Anchorage, one of the top enterprise digital asset custodians.

Today, Anchorage announced support for custody of XRP, which will enable its growing roster of enterprise customers to securely store XRP for various use cases.‌‌

Anchorage’s uncompromising commitment to security is evident in the custody product that it has built, which we at Xpring believe to be world-class.

Anchorage’s support of XRP is a great addition to the XRP community and will continue to serve as an option for users to securely hold and use their XRP.
