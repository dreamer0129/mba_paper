Team Ripple

Just as April ushers in feelings of renewal and energy with the start of Spring, this month also signals one of Ripple’s favorite programs: Development Month. To support employees, we have built a Learning and Development program to ensure all Ripplers have the tools, guidance and programs needed to succeed at Ripple and beyond.

It all starts with an Individual Development Plan (IDP). Each Rippler receives a ‘Design Your Path’ workbook to assess where they are now and identify where they would like to focus their efforts for the year in order to create an action plan. We also provide 1:1 career coaching for any employee who wants to work with a certified coach as they are drafting their IDP.

Once a plan is in hand, Ripplers can also take advantage of additional learning experiences throughout the year, to optimize their impact:

And, while these programs are well-regarded, the highest value learning experiences come day-to-day from being a part of a world-class, talented team working on solving global problems at scale.
