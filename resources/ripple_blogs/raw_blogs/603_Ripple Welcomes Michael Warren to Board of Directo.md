## 核心内容

Team Ripple

It’s been an exciting and fast start to the year here at Ripple. From welcoming many new team members, to launching our annual crypto trends report, to seeing exciting momentum with the Creator Fund. We hit the ground running at the start of 2022 with no plans of slowing down.

Equally as exciting is the announcement of our newest board member, Michael Warren. He joins Ripple with over 20 years of experience advising clients on international growth strategies, stakeholder management issues, and economic and geopolitical issues affecting global markets. Warren is Managing Director of Albright Stonebridge Group, part of Dentons Global Advisors, where he consults companies, investors, and stakeholders on navigating challenging business and regulatory landscapes in new and emerging markets.

Prior to his tenure at ASG, Warren served on the administrations of two U.S. presidents. He was Senior Advisor of the White House Presidential Personnel Office during President Barack Obama’s first term. And in 2010, President Obama appointed Warren to serve on the Board of Directors of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, where he served on the Audit Committee until his term ended in 2019. During the Clinton administration, he was Executive Director of the National Economic Council at the White House and served in the Office of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor.

Warren’s educational background is just as impressive as his professional one. He received degrees from Yale University — where he currently serves as a Trustee and is a member of the Yale Corporation Investment Committee — and Oxford University where he was a Rhodes Scholar.

Accelerating Global Growth and Market Expansion

Warren joins our Board of Directors at a critical time. He will be a key part of our larger growth strategy to help strengthen Ripple’s global presence as we continue to champion regulatory clarity in the U.S. and expand our presence in global markets as the leading provider of crypto solutions for business.

“I’m excited to join Ripple at such a pivotal moment in history, both for the company as well as crypto at large,” said Michael Warren. “I have long admired the tenacity shown by Ripple and its management team, using regulatory setbacks in the U.S. as an opportunity to pioneer crypto regulation for the benefit of industry innovation and establish an equal playing field for all. I look forward to being a part of Ripple’s efforts to move the needle forward on crypto regulation while the company further solidifies its position as a leader in global finance and the digital economy.”
