Team Ripple

In May 2023, Ripple and Fubon Bank were selected to demonstrate a use case for the settlement of tokenized assets as part of the e-HKD Pilot Programme for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). In partnership with Fubon Bank, Ripple is pioneering a groundbreaking Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) pilot designed to streamline access to excess property equity for Hong Kong citizens. The pilot leverages the Ripple CBDC Platform for the creation of a hypothetical e-HKD.

The consortium of partners supporting Ripple and Fubon Bank on this project as part of e-HKD Pilot Programme includes:

This innovative solution explores home equity lending by combining a hypothetical e-HKD (CBDC) as a settlement asset with tokenized real estate and advanced finance lending protocols, leveraging technology to revolutionize the lending landscape.

The marriage of digital innovation and traditional banking processes allows users to embark on a seamless journey towards unlocking the untapped equity in their properties.

In the proposed solution, Fubon Bank, Ripple and its partners are employing state-of-the-art technology to provide a novel Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) pilot project for Hong Kong citizens. This transformative process begins with Fubon Bank securely minting hypothetical e-HKD, supported by a ledger fortified with robust multisig functionality.

The integration of a hypothetical e-HKD into the HELOC facility potentially offers numerous advantages. Users benefit from a streamlined online platform that provides quick loan approvals and 24/7 access to property equity. They also gain transparency and control through real-time data on Loan-to-Value Ratios (LVR), available funds, and interest accrual.

From an operational perspective, the solution enhances efficiency with end-to-end cryptography, guaranteeing auditable records, reducing manual processes, and enabling real-time reporting.

The journey of innovation Fubon Bank, Ripple, Kodelab, TOKO, HexTrust, BWC and Stratford Finance have collaborated on has delivered a number of key insights:

The ongoing pilot focuses on creating a working Property Tokenization and HELOC use case, with plans to expand based on findings. Potential developments include full property title deed tokenization, extending the pilot to broader lending markets, and exploring international applications.

For further details regarding the pilot, you can access our white paper, design paper, or expanded document describing the innovative project.

Stay tuned as Ripple and Fubon Bank alongside an expert consortium of partners pave the way for universal access to liquidity through tokenized property, transcending borders and limitations.
